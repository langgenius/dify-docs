#### **SOC 2 Type I Report**

A **SOC 2 Type I** report is a third-party audit report that evaluates and confirms the design and implementation of an organization's security controls at a specific point in time. SOC 2, which stands for **System and Organization Controls 2**, is a set of criteria for managing and protecting data based on five trust service principles: **Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy**. The Type I report specifically assesses whether an organization has appropriate controls in place to meet the relevant criteria at the time of the audit.

#### **GDPR Data Protection Agreement**

A **Data Protection Agreement (DPA)** is a legally binding contract between a **data controller** and a **data processor** under the General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**). The GDPR, which came into effect in May 2018, sets out the legal framework for data protection within the European Union (EU), and applies to organizations that process personal data of EU residents. A DPA is required when a data controller engages a third-party processor to handle personal data, ensuring that both parties are in compliance with GDPR obligations and safeguarding the rights of individuals whose data is being processed.

**Everyone** can Download Dify's DPA in our official website.
