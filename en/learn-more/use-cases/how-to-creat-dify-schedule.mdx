### 🚫 Connection Issues?

If you're using a self-hosted Dify instance, make sure it's accessible from the public internet - GitHub Actions needs to reach your server!

### ❌ Execution Errors?

1. 🔍 Check if your application is a workflow application
2. ⚙️ If your workflow requires input variables, configure `DIFY_INPUTS` with valid JSON
3. 📝 Read the error logs carefully and ensure all required variables are set correctly
