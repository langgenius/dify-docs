## Enabling Voice Capabilities for Digital AI Avatar

### 🧩 Step 5: Prepare Three Key Configurations Before Running TEN Agent Locally

Before integrating the **Dify agent** and **Trulience digital human** into the TEN platform,  
we need to set up the accounts and credentials required for voice communication and speech processing.

Specifically, you’ll need to prepare the following three components:

---

#### ✅ 1. Agora Real-Time Voice Communication Parameters

TEN uses **Agora** to enable real-time voice interactions (i.e., “she can speak”).  
You’ll need the following parameters:

- `AGORA_APP_ID=`（App ID）

## 🛠️ Next Step: Expansion Suggestions (Based on AX Architecture)

Building upon your current **AI Sales Avatar**,  
you can follow the **AX Architecture** roadmap to further enhance its capabilities in real-world business scenarios.

The goal is to gradually integrate a full-cycle loop of:

**Data → Model → Agent → User Interface → Full Business Lifecycle Management**

---

### 🧑‍💼 Embed on the Company Homepage as a Virtual Brand Representative

By integrating **Trulience**’s D-Human and Avatar capabilities,  
you can deploy your digital human onto the company homepage or web application.

Through natural voice-based Q&A, the avatar can guide visitors, capture their intent,  
and serve as a user-centric entry point that connects to:

- `Marketing Info`  
- `Customer Lifecycle`

---

### 📦 Integrate with Databases & Order Management Systems to Evolve into an “AI Sales Representative”

Connect the Avatar with internal enterprise systems such as:

- CRM, ERP, OA, and order management tools (e.g., Salesforce, SAP, Notion DB, etc.)

This enables the AI agent to perform end-to-end tasks like:

- Sales lead management  
- Inventory checks  
- Contract generation

Serving business processes such as:

- `Contract Lifecycle`  
- `Asset Lifecycle`

---

### 🔗 Integrate with Core Enterprise Platforms: From “Individual Use” to “Organizational Collaboration”

You can further modularize the Agent PF (platform) capabilities  
and embed them into the Data Lakes and workflow management platforms of various BUs.

This unlocks cross-functional integration scenarios such as:

- AI + Finance  
- AI + HR  
- AI + R&D  
- AI + SNS (Collaboration)

Ultimately, it paves the way for a company-wide AI transformation and upgrade.

---

## ✨ Final Reflections

I’ve always believed that AI should not merely be a cold, powerful tool —  
but also a **warm companion to humanity**,  
an extension and amplifier of our individual potential.

In the near future, we may see more digital companions like **“Vendy”** quietly emerge across the world —  
beings who **listen**, **think**, **respond**, and **express**,  
using the power of technology to uphold **human dignity and creativity**.

---

If you, too, wish to join this global journey of co-creation,  
we warmly invite you to **explore, experiment, and share** —  
so that every individual can grow alongside AI,  
and together, we may step into the AX era of:

> **“One Against a Thousand — Leaving No One Behind.”**
---

### 🌱 A Humble Beginning

This document is just a small experiment — a seed of possibility.  
May it quietly take root, and gently begin to sprout  
in a future where **humans and AI coexist in harmony**.
