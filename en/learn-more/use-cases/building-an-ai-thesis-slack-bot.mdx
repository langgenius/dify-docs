> Author：Alec Lee. 2025/03/11

## 1. Overview

With the rapid growth of academic research in the information age, researchers require more efficient ways to access the latest findings. The AI Thesis Slack Bot streamlines this process by leveraging AI-driven automated workflows, enabling users to quickly retrieve arXiv paper summaries within Slack.

This tool can be used in various real estate-related contexts, such as:

* Research teams tracking the latest AI advancements in real estate technology  
* Internal synchronization of information for AI research departments in real estate firms  
* Academic collaborations between university faculty and students on real estate innovation

This guide will walk you through setting up the AI Thesis Slack Bot, its core operating principles, and how to maximize its efficiency to enhance productivity in the real estate sector.

## 2. Preparation

### 2.1 Configuring the OpenAI API

Set up OpenAI in your account’s model settings and install the API key.

## 3. Setting Up the AI Thesis Slack Bot Workflow

The AI Thesis Slack Bot operates through the following automated process:

**a. User Input:** The user enters a keyword (e.g., *"Large Language Model"*) in the Dify AI Thesis Slack Bot.  
**b.Paper Retrieval:** The bot queries arXiv for relevant research papers, filtering for the most recent publications (e.g., papers published after January 1, 2024).

**c.AI-Powered Summarization:** Using GPT-4o, the bot processes and summarizes the papers, then formats the summary for Slack in the following structure:

 📄 **Title:** \[Paper Title\]  
 👤 **Author(s):** \[Author Names\]  
 📆 **Publication Date:** \[Date\]  
 📌 **Summary:** \[Key takeaways from the paper\]

**d.Automated Slack Push:** The bot automatically posts the summary to a designated Slack channel, ensuring that team members can quickly access the latest research updates—whether in a public channel or private messages.

## 4. Implementation Steps

### 4.1 Creating the Workflow

a. On the Dify homepage, select Create from Blank, then choose Workflow and enter a name (e.g., *AI Thesis Slack Bot*).
