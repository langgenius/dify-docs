### Clone Dify

Clone the Dify source code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone --branch "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/langgenius/dify/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)" https://github.com/langgenius/dify.git
```

### Starting Dify

1.  Navigate to the Docker directory in the Dify source code

    ```bash
    cd dify/docker
    ```
2.  Copy the environment configuration file

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  Update directory ownership on the host

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R 1001:1001 ./volumes/app/storage
    ```
4.  Start the Docker containers

    Choose the appropriate command to start the containers based on the Docker Compose version on your system. You can use the `$ docker compose version` command to check the version, and refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for more information:

    * If you have Docker Compose V2, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    * If you have Docker Compose V1, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

After executing the command, you should see output similar to the following, showing the status and port mappings of all containers:

```bash

```

Finally, check if all containers are running successfully:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

This includes 3 core services: `api / worker / web`, and 6 dependent components: `weaviate / db / redis / nginx / ssrf_proxy / sandbox` .

```

With these steps, you should be able to install Dify successfully.

### Upgrade Dify

Enter the docker directory of the dify source code and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd dify/docker
docker compose down
git pull origin main
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

#### Sync Environment Variable Configuration (Important)

* If the `.env.example` file has been updated, be sure to modify your local `.env` file accordingly.
* Check and modify the configuration items in the `.env` file as needed to ensure they match your actual environment. You may need to add any new variables from `.env.example` to your `.env` file, and update any values that have changed.

### Access Dify

Access administrator initialization page to set up the admin account:

```bash
# Local environment
http://localhost/install

# Server environment
http://your_server_ip/install
```

Dify web interface address:

```bash
# Local environment
http://localhost

# Server environment
http://your_server_ip
```

### Customize Dify

Edit the environment variable values in your `.env` file directly. Then, restart Dify with:

```
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

The full set of annotated environment variables along can be found under docker/.env.example.
