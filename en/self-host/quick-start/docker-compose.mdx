## Clone Dify

Clone the Dify source code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone --branch "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/langgenius/dify/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)" https://github.com/langgenius/dify.git
```

## Start Dify

1.  Navigate to the Docker directory in the Dify source code

    ```bash
    cd dify/docker
    ```
2.  Copy the environment configuration file

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  Update directory ownership on the host

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R 1001:1001 ./volumes/app/storage
    ```
4.  Start the Docker containers

    Choose the appropriate command to start the containers based on the Docker Compose version on your system. You can use the `docker compose version` command to check the version, and refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for more information:

    * If you have Docker Compose V2, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    * If you have Docker Compose V1, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    After executing the command, you should see output similar to the following, showing the status and start time of all containers:

    ```bash

    ```

5. Check if all containers are running successfully

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

    This includes 5 core services: `api / worker / worker_beat / web / plugin_daemon`, and 6 dependent components: `weaviate / db_postgres / redis / nginx / ssrf_proxy / sandbox` .

    ```

With these steps, you should be able to install Dify successfully.

## Upgrade Dify

Enter the docker directory of the dify source code and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd dify/docker
docker compose down
git pull origin main
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

<Note>
  * If the `.env.example` file has been updated, be sure to modify your local `.env` file accordingly.

  * Check and modify the configuration items in the `.env` file as needed to ensure they match your actual environment. You may need to add any new variables from `.env.example` to your `.env` file, and update any values that have changed.
</Note>

## Access Dify

Access administrator initialization page to set up the admin account:

```bash
# Local environment
http://localhost/install

# Server environment
http://your_server_ip/install
```

Dify web interface address:

```bash
# Local environment
http://localhost

# Server environment
http://your_server_ip
```

## Customize Dify

Edit the environment variable values in your `.env` file directly. Then, restart Dify with:

```
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

<Tip>
  The full set of annotated environment variables along can be found under `docker/.env.example`. For more information, see [environment variables](/en/self-host/configuration/environments).
