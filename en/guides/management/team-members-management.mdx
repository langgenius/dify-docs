> For Community Edition, enabling email functionality requires the team owner to configure and activate the email service via system [environment variables](/en/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

- If the invited member has not registered with Dify, they will receive an invitation email. They can complete registration by clicking the link in the email.
- If the invited member is already registered with Dify, permissions will be automatically assigned and **no invitation email will be sent**. The invited member can switch to the new workspace via the menu in the top right corner.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. How can I transfer team ownership?

Team owners have the highest level of permissions. To maintain the stability of the team structure, team ownership cannot be manually transferred once established.

#### 2. How can I delete a team?

For team data security reasons, team owners cannot delete their teams on their own.

#### 3. How can I delete a team member's account?

Neither team owners nor administrators can delete a team member's account. Account deletion requires the account owner to actively request it, and cannot be performed by others. As an alternative to account deletion, removing a member from the team will revoke that user's access to the team.
