One of the benefits of creating AI applications with Dify is that you can publish a Single-page AI web app accessible to all users on the internet within minutes.

* If you're using the self-hosted open-source version, the application will run on your server
* If you're using the cloud service, the application will be hosted at [https://udify.app/](https://udify.app/).
