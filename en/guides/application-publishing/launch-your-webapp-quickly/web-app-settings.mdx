Web applications are designed for application users. When an application developer creates an application on Dify, a corresponding web application is generated. Users of the web application can use it without logging in. The web application is adapted for various device sizes: PC, tablet, and mobile.

The content of the web application aligns with the configuration of the published application. When the application's configuration is modified and the "Publish" button is clicked on the prompt orchestration page, the web application's content will be updated according to the current configuration of the application.

On the application overview page, you can enable or disable access to the web application and modify the web application's site information, including:

* Icon
* Name
* Application description
* Interface language
* Copyright information
* Privacy policy link

The functionality and performance of the web application depend on whether the developer has enabled these features during application orchestration, such as:

* Conversation opening remarks
* Variables to be filled before the conversation
* Next step suggestions
* Speech-to-text
* References and attributions
* More similar answers (for text-based applications)
* ......

In the following sections, we will introduce the two types of web applications:

* Text Generation
* Conversational
