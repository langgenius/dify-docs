Conversational applications engage in continuous dialogue with users in a question-and-answer format. These applications support the following features (ensure these functions are enabled during application orchestration):

* Variables filled out before the conversation.
* Creation, pinning, and deletion of conversations.
* Conversation opening statements.
* Next step question suggestions.
* Speech-to-text.
* References and attributions.

### Variables Filled Out Before the Conversation

If you have set variable filling requirements during application orchestration, you will need to fill out the prompted information before entering the conversation window:

Fill in the necessary details and click the "Start Conversation" button to begin chatting. Hover over the AI's response to copy the conversation content, and provide "like" or "dislike" feedback.

_Please ensure that your device environment is authorized to use the microphone._
