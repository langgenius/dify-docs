1. Click **Knowledge** > **Create Knowledge**, then [upload local files](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/import-content-data/readme), [sync data from Notion](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/import-content-data/sync-from-notion), or [webpages](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/import-content-data/sync-from-website), or create an empty knowledge base.

2. [Configure the chunk settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/chunking-and-cleaning-text) and preview the chunking results. This stage involves content preprocessing and structuring, where long texts are divided into multiple smaller chunks.

3. [Specify the index method and retrieval settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/setting-indexing-methods). Once the knowledge base receives a user query, it searches existing documents according to preset retrieval methods and extracts highly relevant content chunks.

4. Wait for the data processing to complete.
