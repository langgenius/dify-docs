To quick-create and configure a knowledge base:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Import Data">

        1. Click **Knowledge** > **Create Knowledge**.

        2. [Upload local files](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/import-content-data/readme), [sync content from Notion](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/import-content-data/sync-from-notion), or [import from websites](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/import-content-data/sync-from-website). You can also start with an empty knowledge base and populate it later.

        <Note>
            Once a knowledge base is created, its data source cannot be changed later.
        </Note>
    
    </Step>
    <Step title="Turn Data into Retrievable Knowledge">

        1. [Configure the chunk settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/chunking-and-cleaning-text) to define how raw data is pre-processed and split into smaller chunks, so each piece of content can be retrieved more efficiently and precisely within LLM context limits.
    
        2. [Choose an index method](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/setting-indexing-methods) to control how chunks are represented and made searchable—either as vectors for high-quality semantic matching or as keywords for cost-efficient retrieval. 

        3. [Configure the retrieval settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/configure-retrieval-settings) to specify how the most relevant chunks are matched against user queries.
    
    </Step>
</Steps>

After a knowledge base is successfully created, you can:

- [Review and modify the content chunks](/en/guides/knowledge-base/knowledge-and-documents-maintenance/maintain-knowledge-documents) to ensure they are appropriately chunked for retrieval.

- [Simulate user queries](/en/guides/knowledge-base/retrieval-test-and-citation) to test and refine retrieval performance.

- [Add metadata to documents](/en/guides/knowledge-base/metadata) to enable filter-based retrieval.

Once the knowledge is retrieval-ready, you can [integrate it into your apps](/en/guides/knowledge-base/integrate-knowledge-within-application).

As your data or requirements evolve, you can [adjust the knowledge base settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-creation/introduction) at any time.

<Tip>
    You can always convert a quick-created knowledge base into a pipeline-created one for more advanced configurations and customizations.
