* **Knowledge Name**: Used to distinguish among different knowledge bases.
* **Knowledge Description**: Used to describe the information represented by the documents in the knowledge base.
* **Permission**: Defines access control for the knowledge base with three levels:
  * **"Only Me"**: Restricts access to the knowledge base owner.
  * **"All team members"**: Grants access to every member of the team.
  * **"Partial team members"**: Allows selective access to specific team members.
  
    Users without appropriate permissions cannot access the knowledge base. When granting access to team members (Options 2 or 3), authorized users are granted full permissions, including the ability to view, edit, and delete knowledge base content.

* **Indexing Mode**: For detailed explanations, please refer to the [documentation](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/setting-indexing-methods).
* **Embedding Model**: Allows you to modify the embedding model for the knowledge base. Changing the embedding model will re-embed all documents in the knowledge base, and the original embeddings will be deleted.
* **Retrieval Settings**: For detailed explanations, please refer to the [documentation](/en/learn-more/extended-reading/retrieval-augment/retrieval).
