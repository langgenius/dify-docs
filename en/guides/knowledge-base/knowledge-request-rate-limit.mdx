title: Knowledge Request Rate Limit
---

We will implement Knowledge Request Rate Limits starting **February 24, 2025**, to ensure optimal service performance and a better knowledge experience for all users.

## What is Knowledge Request Rate Limit?

Knowledge Request Rate Limit refers to the maximum number of actions that a workspace can perform in the knowledge base within one minute. These actions include creating datasets, managing documents, and running queries in apps or workflows.

## Limitations of Different Subscription Versions

Knowledge Request Rate Limit will vary by subscription level:

-   **Sandbox**: 10/min
-   **Professional**: 100/min
-   **Team**: 1,000/min

For example, if a Sandbox user performs 10 hit tests within one minute, their workspace will be temporarily unable to perform the restricted actions during the following minute.

## Which Actions will be Limited by Knowledge Request Rate Limit when I Perform them?

When you perform the following actions, you will be limited by the frequency of Knowledge Base requests:

1.  Creating empty datasets
2.  Deleting datasets
3.  Updating dataset settings
4.  Uploading documents
5.  Deleting documents
6.  Updating documents
7.  Disabling documents
8.  Enabling documents
9.  Archiving documents
10. Restoring archived documents
11. Pausing document processing
12. Resuming document processing
13. Adding segments
14. Deleting segments
15. Updating segments
16. Bulk importing segments
17. Performing hit tests
18. Querying the knowledge in apps or workflows (*Note: Multi-path recalls count as a single request.*)
