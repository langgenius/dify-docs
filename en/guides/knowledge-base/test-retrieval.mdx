title: Test Knowledge Retrieval
---

In a knowledge base, click the **Retrieval Testing** icon in the left sidebar to enter the testing page. 

Here, you can simulate user queries to test how well the knowledge base retrieves relevant information and experiment with different retrieval settings for optimal performance. 

<Note>
    Retrieval settings adjusted here are temporary and only apply to the current test session.
</Note>

<Tip>
    For more on retrieval settings, see [Configure the Retrieval Settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/setting-indexing-methods#configure-the-retrieval-settings).
</Tip>

The **Records** section logs all retrieval events associated with this knowledge base, including:

- Queries tested directly on the **Retrieval Testing** page
- Retrieval requests made by any linked app—whether during test runs or in production

<Info>
    Test retrievals and regular retrievals use the same API endpoint.
