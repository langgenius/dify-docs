sidebarTitle: Sync from Notion
---

When quick-creating a knowledge base, you can use Notion as its data source, importing specific pages and synchronizing them when their content is updated.

## Import Notion Pages

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the Notion Plugin">
        Go to **Settings** > **Data Source**, then find and install the Notion data source plugin from the recommendation list.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect a Notion Workspace to Dify">
        Click **+ Configure** to authorize Dify to access your Notion workspace via OAuth or API key.
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="OAuth">

                <Tip>
                    On Dify Cloud, the Notion data source plugin comes pre-configured with a default OAuth client that allows one-click authorization.
                </Tip>
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="API Key">
                placeholder
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        <Info>
            Once a workspace is connected, you can set it as the default import source, rename it, change which pages are authorized, or remove it from Dify.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Import Notion Content">
        1. Click **Create** > **Create Knowledge**, then select **Sync from Notion** as the data source.

        2. Choose the target workspace and select the pages you want to import.

        <Note>
            Images and files cannot be imported; data from tables will be converted to plain text.
        </Note>
        <Tip>
            Database pages can also be imported with their page properties preserved.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Synchronize Imported Notion Pages

If the content of an imported page is updated in Notion, you can synchronize the changes by clicking **Sync** for the corresponding page.

<Note>
    For knowledge bases using the **High Quality** index method, synchronization requires re-embedding, which will consume tokens from the embedding model.
