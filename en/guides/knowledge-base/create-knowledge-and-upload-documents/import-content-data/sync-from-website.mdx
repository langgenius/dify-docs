title: 1.2 Import Data from Website

The knowledge base supports crawling content from public web pages using third-party tools such as [Jina Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/) and [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/), parsing it into Markdown content, and importing it into the knowledge base.

<Info>
â€‹[Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and [Jina Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/) are both open-source web parsing tools that can convert web pages into clean Markdown format text that is easy for LLMs to recognize, while providing easy-to-use API services.
