title: Choose an Index Method
---

After configuring the chunk settings, you need to specify the index method for chunks.

## What Does the Index Method Do in Knowledge Retrieval?

When you import files, webpages, or other content into a knowledge base, they are first split—according to the chunk settings—into smaller pieces called chunks.

**The index method defines how these chunks are turned into searchable representations**, so they can be quickly and accurately retrieved to match a query. These representations are stored and form the **index** of the knowledge base.

When a user asks a question, it is converted into a compatible representation using the same index method, and then used to search the index and find the most relevant chunks.

## High Quality vs. Economical 

Dify supports two index methods: **High Quality** and **Economical**. Choosing between them means choosing how a chunk is represented and made searchable—either a vector or a set of keywords.

<Note>
  Once created, a knowledge base can be upgraded from **Economical** to **High Quality**, but not the other way around.

  <Tab title="High Quality">

    With the **High Quality** index method, each chunk is converted into a vector representation by an embedding model (which consumes tokens). This process is called embedding.

    Think of these vectors as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space—the closer two points are, the more similar their meanings. This allows the system to find relevant information based on semantic similarity, not just exact keyword matches.

    <Tip>
      Quick-created knowledge bases don't allow selecting embedding models that support image embedding (indicated by the **Vision** icon) and thus don't support image-based retrieval.
    
      But don't worry—you can easily convert a quick-created knowledge base into a pipeline-created one to enable this feature.

    Once embedded, chunks can be retrieved using one of three strategies: **Vector Search**, **Full-Text Search**, or **Hybrid Search**. Learn more in [Configure the Retrieval Settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/configure-retrieval-settings).

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Economical">

    With the **Economical** index method, each chunk is represented by 10 keywords extracted from its content—no tokens are consumed, but matching is more surface-level.

    This index method only supports the **Inverted Index** retrieval strategy. Learn more in [Configure the Retrieval Settings](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/configure-retrieval-settings).

When choosing the index method, you are mainly making two trade-offs:

- **Retrieval Quality vs. Cost**

  - **High Quality**: better semantic recall, suitable when answer relevance is critical.

  - **Economical**: no token usage and lower cost, suitable for scenarios with less strict recall requirements.

- **Semantic Understanding vs. Keyword-based Matching**

  - **High Quality** is better at understanding synonyms, paraphrases, and long or fuzzy questions.

  - **Economical** is better when users rely on clear keywords, terms, or exact phrases present in the content.
