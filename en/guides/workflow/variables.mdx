title: Variables

## Introduction

A variable is a labeled container that stores information in your Workflow or Chatflow. Each variable holds a piece of data—whether it's user input, system-generated values, or outputs from previous nodes. When you need to use this information later, you simply reference it by its name.

You'll work with different types of variables, each serving a specific purpose in your app's data flow.

## Variable Types

### Input Variable

- **User input variable**: Collects information from end users when they run your app, defined in a User Input node. For example, a user might provide a name, upload a file, or enter a question to be processed by the app.

  <Tip>
    For more about user input variables, see [User Input](/en/guides/workflow/node/user-input).
  </Tip>

- **Node input variable**: Defines what data each node receives from upstream nodes to perform its task, such as the text for an LLM node to process, a query for a Knowledge Retrieval node to search for, or a conditional value for an IF/ELSE node to evaluate.

### Output Variable

- **Node output variable**: Holds the results generated by a node after it completes its task. They can be referenced by downstream nodes as their input.

- **Application output variable**: Returns information to the end user, specified in an [Output node](/en/guides/workflow/node/output) (in Workflows) or an [Answer node](/en/guides/workflow/node/answer) (in Chatflows).

### System Variable

System variables are pre-set, system-level parameters that are globally available.

  <Tab title="Workflow">

    | Variable Name | <div style={{width: '70px'}}>Data Type</div> | Description |
    |:----------------|:-----------|:-------------|
    | `sys.user_id` | String | A unique ID assigned to each user running the app. |
    | `sys.app_id` | String | The unique ID of the app. |
    | `sys.workflow_id` | String | The unique ID of the workflow. |
    | `sys.workflow_run_id` | String | A unique ID generated for each workflow execution. |
    | `sys.timestamp` | String | The timestamp indicating when each workflow execution started. |

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Chatflow">
    
    | Variable Name | <div style={{width: '70px'}}>Data Type</div> | Description |
    |:----------------|:-----------|:-------------|
    | `sys.conversation_id` | String | A unique ID for the conversation session. <br/><br/>It groups all related messages under the same conversation so the LLM can maintain topic continuity and context awareness throughout the chat. |
    | `sys.dialogue_count` | Number | The total number of dialogue turns in the user's interaction with the chatflow. <br/><br/>Starting from 1, it increments after each round and can be used with an IF/ELSE node to create conditional logic.<br/><br/>For example, you can trigger a LLM-generated summary or analysis when `sys.dialogue_count` reaches a certain number. |
    | `sys.user_id` | String | A unique ID assigned to each user running the app. <Note> Conversations are not shared between the web app and backend service APIs. A user with the same `sys.user_id` will have separate conversation histories across different interfaces.</Note>|
    | `sys.app_id` | String | The unique ID of the app. |
    | `sys.workflow_id` | String | The unique ID of the workflow. |
    | `sys.workflow_run_id` | String | A unique ID generated for each chatflow execution. |

### Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to store sensitive information—such as API keys, database passwords, or other credentials—that is used in your app. 

Instead of hardcoding these values directly into your app logic, you define them once as environment variables and reference them throughout your workflow.

This allows a clean separation between secrets and the Dify app itself, so you don't have to risk exposing passwords and keys when sharing your app's DSL.

<Info>
  Environment variables are constant—once set, they cannot be updated during workflow execution.
</Info>

Supported data types:

- **String**: Text values like API endpoints or usernames.
- **Number**: Numeric values such as IDs, rate limits, or port numbers.
- **Secret**: Sensitive values like passwords or API keys. Secret variables are masked in the interface after saving.

### Conversation Variables

> Conversation variables are only applicable to [Chatflow](/en/guides/workflow/key-concepts#chatflow-and-workflow) App.

**Conversation variables allow application developers to specify particular information that needs to be temporarily stored within the same Chatflow session, ensuring that this information can be referenced across multiple rounds of chatting within the current chatflow**. This can include context, files uploaded to the chatting box(coming soon), user preferences input during the conversation, etc. It's like providing a "memo" for the LLM that can be checked at any time, avoiding information bias caused by LLM memory errors.

For example, you can store the language preference input by the user in the first round of chatting in a conversation variable. The LLM will refer to the information in the conversation variable when answering and use the specified language to reply to the user in subsequent chats.

**Conversation variables** support the following eight data types:

* String
* Number
* Object
* Boolean
* Array\[string]
* Array\[number]
* Array\[object]
* Array\[boolean]

**Conversation variables** have the following features:

* Conversation variables can be referenced globally within most nodes in the same Chatflow App;
* Writing to conversation variables requires using the [Variable Assigner](/en/guides/workflow/node/variable-assigner) node;
* Conversation variables are read-write variables;

About how to use conversation variables with the Variable Assigner node, please refer to the [Variable Assigner](/en/guides/workflow/node/variable-assigner).

To track changes in conversation variable values during debugging the app, click the conversation variable icon at the top of the Chatflow app preview page.

## Notice

* To avoid variable name duplication, node naming must not be repeated
* The output variables of nodes are generally fixed variables and cannot be edited
