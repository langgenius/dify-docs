## Introduction

<Info>
  Triggers are available for workflow applications only.
</Info>

A trigger is a type of Start node that enables your workflow to run automatically on a schedule or in response to events that occur in external systems (e.g., GitHub, Stripe, or your own internal systems), rather than waiting for active initiation from a user or an API call.

Triggers are ideal for automating repetitive tasks or integrating your workflow with third-party applications to achieve automated data synchronization and processing.

A workflow can start with multiple triggers, each working in parallel. In the **Logs** section, you can view the trigger source for each workflow execution.

To add a trigger to your workflow, click **Add Node** > **Start**, then choose from the schedule trigger, the webhook trigger, or any available plugin triggers. You can also search for more trigger plugins in [Dify Marketplace](https://marketplace.dify.ai/).

## Trigger Types

- [Schedule Trigger](/en/guides/workflow/node/schedule-trigger)

  - Your workflow runs at specified times or intervals.

  - Example: Automatically generate a daily sales report every morning at 9 AM and send it via email to your team.

- [Plugin Trigger](/en/guides/workflow/node/plugin-trigger)

  - Your workflow runs when a specific event occurs in a connected third-party system, via subscriptions to events predefined by a trigger plugin.

  - Example: Automatically analyze and archive new messages in a specific Slack channel with a subscription to the predefined New message in channel event through the Slack trigger plugin.

- [Webhook Trigger](/en/guides/workflow/node/webhook-trigger)

  - Your workflow runs when a specific event occurs in a third-party system via custom webhooks.
  
  - Example: Automatically process new orders in response to an HTTP request containing the order details from your e-commerce platform.

<Tip>
  Both plugin triggers and webhook triggers make your workflow *event-driven*. 
  
  Here's how to choose:

  1. Use a plugin trigger when there's a trigger plugin available for the target external system. You can simply subscribe to predefined events.

  2. Use a webhook trigger when no plugin exists or you need to subscribe to events not supported by the available plugin. In such cases, you will need to set up custom webhooks in the external system.
</Tip>

## Enable or Disable Triggers

In the **Quick Setting** side menu, you can enable or disable added triggers. Disabled triggers will not initiate workflow execution.

## Test Multiple Triggers

When your workflow has multiple triggers, you can click **Test run** > **Run all triggers** to test them at once. The first activated trigger will initiate the workflow; any other triggers will then be ignored.

After you click **Run all triggers**:

- Schedule triggers will run at the next scheduled execution time.

- Plugin triggers will listen for subscribed events.

- Webhook triggers will listen for incoming HTTP requests.
