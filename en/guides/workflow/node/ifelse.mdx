title: Conditional Branch IF/ELSE
---

### Definition

Allows you to split the workflow into two branches based on if/else conditions.

A conditional branching node has three parts:

* IF Condition: Select a variable, set the condition, and specify the value that satisfies the condition.
* IF condition evaluates to `True`, execute the IF path.
* IF condition evaluates to `False`, execute the ELSE path.
* If the ELIF condition evaluates to `True`, execute the ELIF path;
* If the ELIF condition evaluates to `False`, continue to evaluate the next ELIF path or execute the final ELSE path.

**Condition Types**

The available condition types depend on the variable's data type:

**For String/Number/Object variables:**
* Contains
* Not contains
* Starts with
* Ends with
* Is
* Is not
* Is empty
* Is not empty

**For Boolean variables:**
* Is (True/False)
* Is not (True/False)

**For Array[Boolean] variables:**
* Contains (True/False)
* Not contains (True/False)
* Is empty
* Is not empty

### Scenario

Taking the above **Text Summary Workflow** as an example:

* IF Condition: Select the `summarystyle` variable from the start node, with the condition **Contains** `technical`.
* IF condition evaluates to `True`, follow the IF path by querying technology-related knowledge through the knowledge retrieval node, then respond via the LLM node (as shown in the upper half of the diagram);
* IF condition evaluates to `False`, but an `ELIF` condition is added, where the input for the `summarystyle` variable **does not include** `technology`, yet the `ELIF` condition includes `science`, check if the condition in `ELIF` is `True`, then execute the steps defined within that path;
* If the condition within `ELIF` is `False`, meaning the input variable contains neither `technology` nor `science`, continue to evaluate the next `ELIF` condition or execute the final `ELSE` path;
* IF condition evaluates to `False`, i.e., the `summarystyle` variable input **does not contain** `technical`, execute the ELSE path, responding via the LLM2 node (lower part of the diagram).

**Multiple Condition Judgments**

For complex condition judgments, you can set multiple condition judgments and configure **AND** or **OR** between conditions to take the **intersection** or **union** of the conditions, respectively.
