Start nodes are the entry points of workflows and chatflows.

There are two types of Start nodes, each initiating your application in a different way.

- **[User Input](/en/guides/workflow/node/user-input)**:  The application is initiated by direct user interaction or API calls.

- **[Trigger](/en/guides/workflow/node/trigger)** (for workflows only): The application automatically runs on a schedule or in response to a specific third-party event.

<Note>
  Only applications starting with a User Input node can be published as standalone web apps or MCP servers, exposed through backend service APIs, or used as tools in other Dify applications.
</Note>

<Tip>
  - A single workflow can have both User Input nodes and triggers as parallel start points.
