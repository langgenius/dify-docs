Start nodes are the entry points of workflows and chatflows.

There are two types of Start nodes, each corresponding to a different way to initiate your application.

- **[User Input](/en/guides/workflow/node/user-input)**: Initiate applications through active user interaction or API calls.

- **[Trigger](/en/guides/workflow/node/trigger)** (for workflows only): Automatically run applications on a schedule or when a specific third-party event occurs.

<Note>
  Only applications starting with a User Input node can be published as standalone web apps or MCP servers, accessed via backend service APIs, or used as tools within other applications.
</Note>

<Info>
  - A single workflow can have both user-input nodes and triggers as parallel start points.
  - On a single canvas, you can build multiple independent workflows that begin with their own start node(s).
