Start nodes serve as the entry points for workflows and chatflows.

There are two types of Start nodes, each initiating your application in a different way.

- **[User Input](/en/guides/workflow/node/user-input)**: The application is initiated by direct user interaction or API calls.

- **[Trigger](/en/guides/workflow/node/trigger)** (for workflows only): The application runs automatically on a schedule or in response to a specific third-party event.

<Note>
  Only applications that start with a User Input node can be published as standalone web apps or MCP servers, exposed through backend service APIs, or used as tools in other Dify applications.
</Note>

<Info>
  The User Input node and trigger are mutually exclusive—they cannot be used in the same canvas.
  
  To switch between them, right-click the current start node > **Change Node**. Alternatively, delete the current start node and add a new one.
