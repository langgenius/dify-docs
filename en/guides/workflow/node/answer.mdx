Defining Reply Content in a Chatflow Process. In a text editor, you have the flexibility to determine the reply format. This includes crafting a fixed block of text, utilizing output variables from preceding steps as the reply content, or merging custom text with variables for the response.

Answer node can be seamlessly integrated at any point to dynamically deliver content into the dialogue responses. This setup supports a live-editing configuration mode, allowing for both text and image content to be arranged together. The configurations include:

1. Outputting the reply content from a Language Model (LLM) node.
2. Outputting generated images.
3. Outputting plain text.

Example 1: Output plain text.
