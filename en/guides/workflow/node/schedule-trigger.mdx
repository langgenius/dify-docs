title: Schedule Trigger
---

## Introduction

<Info>
    Triggers are only available for workflow applications.
</Info>

Schedule triggers enable your workflow to run at specified times or intervals. They are ideal for recurring tasks like generating daily reports or sending scheduled notifications.

## Add a Schedule Trigger

In your workflow canvas, right-click and select **Add Node** > **Start** > **Schedule Trigger**.

<Tip>
    A workflow can start with multiple schedule triggers, each working in parallel.
</Tip>

## Configure a Schedule Trigger

You can set the trigger schedule using the default visual picker or cron expressions.

After setting the schedule, you can view the next 5 scheduled execution times to check if the trigger will work as expected.

<Info>
    Schedule triggers do not produce output variables. However, the system variable `sys.timestamp` is updated each time the workflow is initiated by a schedule trigger.
</Info>

### With Visual Picker

Use this for simple and common hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly schedules. For weekly and monthly frequencies, you can select multiple days or dates.

### With Cron Expression

Use this for more complex and precise timing patterns, such as every 15 minutes from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays.

<Tip>
    You can use LLMs to generate cron expressions.
</Tip>

#### Standard Format
A cron expression is a string of characters that can define a schedule for executing your workflow. It consists of five fields separated by spaces, each representing a different time unit.

<Note>
    There must be a space between each unit.
</Note>

```
* * * * *
| | | | |
| | | | |── Day of week (0-7 or SUN-SAT, where both 0 and 7 = Sunday)
| | | |──── Month (1-12 or JAN-DEC)
| | |────── Day of month (1-31)
| |──────── Hour (0-23)
|────────── Minute (0-59)
```

<Info>
    When you specify both day-of-month and day-of-week, the trigger activates on dates that match *either* field. For example, `1 2 3 4 4` will trigger your workflow on both the 3rd of April *and* every Thursday in April, not only on Thursdays that fall on the 3rd.
</Info>

#### Special Characters

| Character | Description | Example |
|:-----------|:-------------|:---------|
| `*` | Means "every". | `*` in the **hour** field means "every hour". |
| `,` | Separates multiple values. | `1,3,5` in the **day-of-week** field means "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday". |
| `-` | Defines a range of values. | `9-17` in the **hour** field means "from 9 AM to 5 PM". |
| `/` | Specifies step values. | `*/15` in the **minute** field means "every 15 minutes". |
| `L` | Means "the last".%%BR%%%%BR%%In the **day-of-month** field, means "the last day of the month".%%BR%%%%BR%%In the **day-of-week** field:%%BR%%• When used individually, means "the last day of the week".%%BR%%• When combined with number, means "the last occurrence of that weekday in the month". | `L` in the **day-of-month** field means "Jan 31, April 30, or Feb 28 in a non-leap year".%%BR%%%%BR%%`L` in the **day-of-week** field means Sunday.%%BR%%%%BR%%`5L` in the **day-of-week** field means "the last Friday of the month". |
| `?` | Means "any" or "no specific value".%%BR%%%%BR%%If you specify a value for the **day-of-week** field, you can use `?` for the **day-of-month** field to ignore it, and vice versa.%%BR%%%%BR%%Not required, as `*` works as well. | To run a task every Monday of the week, it's more precise to set the **day-of-month** field to `?` instead of `*`. |

#### Pre-defined Expressions

- `@yearly`: Run once a year at 12:00 AM on January 1st.
- `@monthly`: Run once a month at 12:00 AM on the first day of the month.
- `@weekly`: Run once a week at 12:00 AM on Sunday.
- `@daily`: Run once a day at 12:00 AM.
- `@hourly`: Run at the beginning of every hour.

#### Examples

| Schedule | Cron Expression |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| Weekdays at 9 AM | `0 9 * * MON-FRI` or `0 9 * 1-5` |
| Every Wednesday at 2:30 PM | `30 14 * * WED` |
| Every Sunday at midnight | `0 0 * * 0` |
| Every 2 hours every Tuesday | `0 */2 * * 2` |
| The first day of every month at midnight | `0 0 1 * *` |

| The last day of every month at 5 PM | `0 17 L * *` |
| The last Friday of every month at 10 PM | `0 22 * * 5L` |

## Test a Schedule Trigger

When you test a schedule trigger (either via a single-node test or by selecting it for a workflow test run), the workflow executes immediately ignoring the configured schedule.

However, when you test a workflow with multiple triggers by clicking **Test run** > **Run all triggers**, the schedule trigger will wait for its next scheduled execution time instead of running instantly.
