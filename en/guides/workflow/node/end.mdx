title: Output
---

<Info>
    - The Output node was previously called End. Unlike before, it's now *optional* in a workflow and used only to explicitly output data to the end user.

    - This node is available in workflow applications only. Chatflows use [Answer nodes](/en/guides/workflow/node/answer) instead to deliver responses during the conversation flow.
</Info>

In an Output node, you can define what data from your workflow should be returned to users by adding output variables, such as an LLM's response. At least one output variable must be specified; otherwise, nothing will be returned.

When exposed as a backend service API, workflows without an Output node will not return any values to API callers.
