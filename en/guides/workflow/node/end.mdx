## Introduction

<Info>
    - The Output node was previously called End. Unlike before, it's now optional in a workflow and is required only when you want to explicitly return data to the end user.

    - This node is available in workflow applications only. Chatflows use [Answer nodes](/en/guides/workflow/node/answer) instead to deliver responses during the conversation flow.
</Info>

In an Output node, you can define what your workflow returns to the end user, such as an LLM's response.

At least one output variable must be specified in an Output node; otherwise, nothing will be returned.

When exposed as a backend service API, workflows without an Output node will not return any values to API callers.
