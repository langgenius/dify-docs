title: Output

## Introduction

<Info>
    - The Output node was previously called End. Unlike before, it's now optional in your workflow and required only when you want to explicitly return data to the end user.

    - This node is available in workflow applications only. Chatflows use [Answer nodes](/en/guides/workflow/node/answer) instead to deliver responses during conversation flow.
</Info>

The Output node defines what your workflow returns as the final result to the end user when it completes, such as an LLM's response or a computed value from a Code node.

No additional nodes can be added after an Output node.

<Note>
    - At least one output variable must be specified in an Output node; otherwise, nothing will be returned.

    - When exposed as a backend service API, workflows without an Output node will not return any values to the API callers.
