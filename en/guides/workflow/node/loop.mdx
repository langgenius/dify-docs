## What is Loop Node?

A **Loop** node executes repetitive tasks that depend on previous iteration results until exit conditions are met or the maximum loop count is reached.

<Info>
The loop can be terminated by either the **Exit Loop Node** or the **Loop Termination Condition**. When either condition is met, the loop will immediately exit.

If no exit conditions are specified, the loop will continue executing (similar to `while (true)`) until it reaches the **Maximum Loop Count**.

## Example 1: Basic Loop

**Goal: Generate random numbers between 1-100 until getting a number less than 50.**

**Steps**:

1. Set up a **Loop** node by configuring its **Loop Termination Condition** to trigger when the **Template** node returns `done`.

2. Set up a **Code** node that generates random integers between `1` and `100`.

3. Set up an **IF/ELSE** node with the following logic:

  - For numbers ≥ 50: Output the `Current Number` and continue the loop

  - For numbers < 50: Output the `Final Number`, and then use the **Template** node to return `done`

4. The workflow terminates automatically once a number below `50` is generated.

## Example 2: Advanced Loop (with Variables and Exit Node)

**Goal: Design a workflow that generates a poem through four iterative refinements, with each version building upon the previous one.**

**Steps:**

1. Set up a **Loop** node with those **Loop Variables**:

  - num: A counter starting at 0, incrementing by 1 per iteration
  
  - verse: A text variable initialized with `I haven't started creating yet`

2. Set up an **IF/ELSE** node that evaluates the iteration count:

  - When num > 3: Proceed the **Exit Loop** node
  
  - When num ≤ 3: Proceed to the **LLM** node

3. Set up an **LLM** node to generate poems.

<Info>
Example Prompt:

You are a European literary figure who can create poetic verses based on `sys.query`.

`verse` is your last creation. You can progress based on your previous work.
</Info>

The first iteration begins with the initial verse value `I haven't started creating yet`. Each subsequent iteration builds upon the previous output, with the new poem replacing the verse variable’s content.

4. Set up a **Variable Assigner** node to manage state:

  - Increment num by 1 after each iteration
  
  - Update verse with the newly generated poem

5. When executed, the workflow will produce four versions of your poem, each iteration building upon its previous output.
