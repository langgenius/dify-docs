## Introduction

<Info>
    Triggers are only available for workflow applications.
</Info>

Through a plugin trigger, you can subscribe to third-party events predefined by an installed trigger plugin. When a subscribed event occurs in that external system, the plugin trigger will automatically initiate your workflow.

Suppose you install a GitHub trigger plugin. This plugin provides a list of GitHub events you can subscribe to, including `Pull Request`, `Push`, and `Issues`. If you subscribe to the `Pull Request` event and add the corresponding plugin trigger to your workflow, your workflow will be triggered whenever someone opens a pull request in the specified repository.

## Add and Configure a Plugin Trigger

1. In your workflow canvas, right-click and select **Add Node** > **Start**, then choose from available plugin triggers or search for more trigger plugins in [Dify Marketplace]().

    <Tip>
        - If there's no ready-made trigger plugin for the target external system, you can [request one from the community](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins/issues/new?template=plugin_request.yaml), [develop one yourself](), or use [webhook triggers](/en/guides/workflow/node/webhook-trigger) instead.

        - A workflow can start with multiple plugin triggers, each working in parallel.
    </Tip>

2. Select from the existing subscriptions or [create a new one](/en/guides/workflow/node/plugin-trigger#create-a-new-subscription).

    <Tip>
        You can see how many workflows a specific subscription is used by in the plugin's details panel under **Plugins**.
    </Tip>

3. Configure any other required settings.

<Info>
    The output variable(s) of a plugin trigger are defined by the corresponding trigger plugin and cannot be modified.
</Info>

## Create a New Subscription

<Note>
    Once created, a subscription cannot be modified. To make changes, delete the existing one and create a new subscription. 
</Note>

<Info>
    Each trigger plugin supports up to 10 subscriptions per workspace.
</Info>

Each subscription is built upon a webhook. When you create a subscription, you're essentially setting up a webhook that listens for events from the external system. 

<Accordion title="What is a webhook?">

    A webhook allows one system to automatically send real-time data to another. When a certain event occurs, the source system packages the event details into an HTTP request and sends it to a designated URL provided by the destination system.

</Accordion>

Dify supports the following two ways to create subscriptions (or say, webhooks), yet the available option depends on how the specific plugin is designed by its developer.

- **Automatic Creation**: You select events you want to subscribe to and Dify automatically creates the webhook for you in the external system. This requires authorization via **OAuth** or **API keys** so Dify can communicate with the external system and handle the webhook setup on your behalf.

- **Manual Creation**: You manually create the webhook yourself using a webhook callback URL provided by Dify. No authorization needed.

<Note>
    It's highly recommended to select all available events when creating a subscription.
    
    A plugin trigger can only work if its corresponding event is included in the subscription you choose for it. Therefore, selecting all available events in one subscription ensures that any plugin trigger you add to the workflow later will work with this single subscription. 
</Note>


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="OAuth">

    Some plugins come with a pre-configured default OAuth client, allowing you to authorize Dify with a single click; some supports only custom OAuth clients, requiring you to create your own OAuth application in the external system; others support both options, so you can choose either as needed.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Default OAuth Client">

                1. When creating a new subscription, select **Create with OAuth** > **Default**.

                2. On the external system's authorization page that pops up, click **Next** to grant Dify access.

                3. Specify the subscription name, select the events you want to subscribe to, and configure any other required settings.

                4. Click **Create**.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Custom OAuth Client">

            1. When creating a new subscription, select **Create with OAuth** > **Custom**.

            2. In the external system, create a new OAuth application using the callback URL provided by Dify.

            3. Back on Difyâ€™s **Create with OAuth** page, enter the client ID and client secret of the created OAuth application, then click **Save and Authorize**.

                <Tip>
                    After configuring and saving the client ID and client secret once, the same credentials can be reused for future subscriptions.
                </Tip>

            4. Specify the subscription name, select the events you want to subscribe to, and configure any other required settings.

            5. Click **Create**.


            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        <Info>
            The **Callback URL** displayed on the subscription configuration page is used internally by Dify when it creates the webhook in the external system on your behalf. You don't need to take any actions with this URL.
        </Info>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="API Key">

    1. When creating a new subscription, select **Create with API Key**.

    2. Get an API key or access token from the external system, paste into the corresponding field, and click **Verify**.

    3. Specify the subscription name, select the events you want to subscribe to, and configure any other required settings.

    4. Click **Create**.

    <Info>
        The **Callback URL** displayed on the subscription configuration page is used internally by Dify when it creates the webhook in the external system on your behalf. You don't need to take any actions with this URL.
    </Info>
    
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Manual Creation">

    1. When creating a new subscription, select **Paste URL to create a new subscription**.

    2. Specify the subscription name and use the provided callback URL to manually create a webhook in the external system. 

    3. Optional: Test the created webhook.

        <Info>
            Typically, once a webhook is successfully created, the external system will send a ping request to Dify to test the webhook out.
        </Info>
    
        1. Perform a subscribed event so the external system sends an HTTP request to the callback URL.

        2. Check the **Request Logs** section on the **Manual Setup** page. If the webhook works properly, you'll see the received request and Dify's response.

    4. Click **Create**.

    </Tab>

## Test a Plugin Trigger

To test an unpublished plugin trigger, make sure to click **Run this step** or test-run the entire workflow so that the trigger enters the listening state and can monitor external events. Otherwise, subscribed events will not be captured.
