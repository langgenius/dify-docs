title: Plugin Trigger
---

## Introduction

<Info>
    Triggers are only available for workflow applications.
</Info>

A plugin trigger automatically initiates your workflow when a specific event occurs in an external system. You can subscribe to these events through a trigger plugin.

For example, suppose you have a GitHub trigger plugin installed. It provides a list of GitHub events you can subscribe to, including `Pull Request`, `Push`, and `Issues`. If you subscribe to the `Pull Request` event and add the corresponding plugin trigger to your workflow, the workflow will be automatically triggered whenever someone opens a pull request in the specified repository.

## Add and Configure a Plugin Trigger

1. On the workflow canvas, right-click and select **Add Node** > **Start**, then choose from available plugin triggers or search for more in [Dify Marketplace](https://marketplace.dify.ai/?category=trigger).

    <Tip>
        - If no trigger plugin exists for your target system, you can [request one from the community](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins/issues/new?template=plugin_request.yaml), [develop one yourself](), or use [webhook triggers](/en/guides/workflow/node/webhook-trigger) instead.

        - A workflow can start with multiple plugin triggers, each working in parallel.
    </Tip>

2. Choose from existing subscriptions or [create a new one](/en/guides/workflow/node/plugin-trigger#create-a-new-subscription).

    <Tip>
        You can check how many workflows use a specific subscription from the plugin's details panel under **Plugins**.
    </Tip>

3. Configure any other required settings.

<Info>
    The output variable(s) of a plugin trigger are defined by its corresponding trigger plugin and cannot be modified.
</Info>

## Create a New Subscription

<Note>
    A subscription cannot be modified once created. To make changes, delete the existing one and create a new subscription. 
</Note>

<Info>
    A trigger plugin supports up to 10 subscriptions per workspace.
</Info>

Each subscription is built upon a webhook. When you create a subscription, you're essentially setting up a webhook that listens for events from an external system. 

<Accordion title="What is a webhook?">

    A webhook allows one system to automatically send real-time data to another. When a certain event occurs, the source system packages the event details into an HTTP request and sends it to a designated URL provided by the destination system.

</Accordion>

Dify supports the following two ways to create subscriptions (webhooks), though the available option depends on how the specific plugin is designed by its developer.

- **Automatic Creation**: You select events you want to subscribe to, and Dify automatically creates the corresponding webhook in the external system. This requires prior authorization via **OAuth** or **API keys** so Dify can handle the webhook setup on your behalf.

- **Manual Creation**: You manually create the webhook yourself using the webhook callback URL provided by Dify. No authorization is needed.

<Tip>
    It's highly recommended to select all available events when creating a subscription.
    
    A plugin trigger works only when its corresponding event is included in the linked subscription. Selecting all available events ensures that any plugin trigger you add to the workflow later will work with a single subscription. 
</Tip>

    <Tab title="OAuth">

    On Dify Cloud, many popular trigger plugins are pre-configured with default OAuth clients so you can authorize Dify with a single click. 
    
    In self-hosted environments, only the custom OAuth client option is available, meaning that you need to create the OAuth application yourself in the external system.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Default OAuth Client">

                1. When creating a new subscription, select **Create with OAuth** > **Default** > **Save and Authorize**.

                    <Info>
                        **Save** sets the selected option as the default OAuth method for future subscriptions.

                        To switch methods later, click the **OAuth Client Settings** icon.
                    </Info>

                2. On the external system's authorization page that pops up, click **Next** to grant Dify access.

                3. Specify the subscription name, select the events you want to subscribe to, and configure any other required settings.

                    <Tip>
                        We recommend selecting all available events.
                    </Tip>

                4. Click **Create**.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Custom OAuth Client">

            1. When creating a new subscription, select **Create with OAuth** > **Custom**.

            2. In the external system, create a new OAuth application using the callback URL provided by Dify.

            3. Back in Dify, enter the client ID and client secret of the newly created OAuth application, then click **Save and Authorize**.

                <Info>
                    Once saved, the same client credentials can be reused for future subscriptions.
                </Info>

            4. Specify the subscription name, select the events you want to subscribe to, and configure any other required settings.
                <Tip>

            5. Click **Create**.

            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        <Info>
            The **Callback URL** displayed on the subscription configuration page is used internally by Dify to create the webhook in the external system on your behalf. 
            
            You don't need to take any actions with this URL.
        </Info>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="API Key">

    1. When creating a new subscription, select **Create with API Key**.

    2. Get an API key or access token from the external system, paste it into the corresponding field, and click **Verify**.

    3. Specify the subscription name, select the events you want to subscribe to, and configure any other required settings.
        <Tip>
            We recommend selecting all available events.
        </Tip>

    4. Click **Create**.

    <Info>
        The **Callback URL** displayed on the subscription configuration page is used internally by Dify when it creates the webhook in the external system on your behalf. 
        
        You don't need to take any actions with this URL.
    </Info>
    
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Manual Creation">

    1. When creating a new subscription, select **Paste URL to create a new subscription**.

    2. Specify the subscription name and use the provided callback URL to manually create a webhook in the external system. 

    3. (Optional) Test the created webhook.

        <Info>
            Most external systems automatically test a new webhook by sending a ping request to Dify upon creation.
        </Info>
    
        1. Trigger a subscribed event so the external system sends an HTTP request to the callback URL.

        2. Check the **Request Logs** section on the **Manual Setup** page. If the webhook works properly, you'll see the received request and Dify's response.

    4. Click **Create**.

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Test a Plugin Trigger

To test an unpublished plugin trigger, make sure to click **Run this step** or test-run the entire workflow first. This puts the trigger into a listening state so that it can monitor external events. Otherwise, subscribed events will not be captured.
