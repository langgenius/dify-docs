title: Go to Anything
---

The **Go to Anything** overlay lets you search and jump to resources across Dify without leaving your keyboard.

### Open the overlay

Press `⌘ + K` on macOS or `Ctrl + K` on Windows/Linux to toggle the search window. Press `Esc` to close it.

### Search and filter

Type a keyword to search all supported resources. Results are grouped by category.
Use the commands below to narrow the scope:

- `@app` – search your applications
- `@plugin` – search installed plugins
- `@kb` or `@knowledge` – search knowledge bases
- `@node` – search nodes in the current workflow (available only when a workflow is open)

Navigate results with the arrow keys and press `Enter` to open the selected item.

### Examples

Try these scoped searches to jump straight to what you need:

- `@app analytics` – open an app whose name contains "analytics"
- `@plugin slack` – go to the Slack plugin
- `@kb company handbook` – look up a knowledge base titled "company handbook"
- `@node summary` – locate a node named "summary" in the current workflow

### Tips

If a search service is temporarily unavailable, Go to Anything shows a warning so you can try again later.
