title: Connecting to OpenLLM Local Deployed Models
---


With [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM), you can run inference with any open-source large-language models, deploy to the cloud or on-premises, and build powerful AI apps.
And Dify supports connecting to OpenLLM deployed large language model's inference capabilities locally.

## Deploy OpenLLM Model
### Starting OpenLLM

Each OpenLLM Server can deploy one model, and you can deploy it in the following way:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3333:3000 ghcr.io/bentoml/openllm start facebook/opt-1.3b --backend pt
```

> Note: Using the `facebook/opt-1.3b` model here is only for demonstration, and the effect may not be good. Please choose the appropriate model according to the actual situation. For more models, please refer to: [Supported Model List](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM#-supported-models).

After the model is deployed, use the connected model in Dify.

   Fill in under `Settings > Model Providers > OpenLLM`:

   - Model Name: `facebook/opt-1.3b`
   - Server URL: `http://<Machine_IP>:3333` Replace with your machine IP address

   Click "Save" and the model can be used in the application.
