title: "Integration with TrueFoundry AI Gateway"
---

TrueFoundry provides an enterprise-ready [AI Gateway](https://www.truefoundry.com/ai-gateway) and integrates seamlessly with Dify, providing enterprise-grade AI features including cost tracking, security guardrails, and access controls.

TrueFoundry's AI Gateway routes all LLM calls through the Gateway to ensure your AI applications are secure, compliant, and cost-effective.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Dify with TrueFoundry, ensure you have:

1. **TrueFoundry Account**: Create a [Truefoundry account](https://www.truefoundry.com/register) and follow the instructions in our [Gateway Quick Start Guide](https://docs.truefoundry.com/gateway/quick-start)
2. **Dify Installation**: Set up Dify using either the [cloud version](https://dify.ai/) or [self-hosted deployment](https://github.com/langgenius/dify) with Docker

## Integration Steps

This guide assumes you have Dify installed and running, and have obtained your TrueFoundry AI Gateway base URL and authentication token.


### Step 1: Access Dify Model Provider Settings

1. Log into your Dify workspace (cloud or self-hosted).

2. Navigate to **Settings** and go to **Model Provider**:

Fill in the following configuration:
- **Model Name**: Enter your TrueFoundry model ID (e.g., `openai-main/gpt-4o`)
- **Model display name**: Enter a display name (e.g., `Gpt-4o`)
- **API Key**: Enter your TrueFoundry API Key
- **API endpoint URL**: Enter your TrueFoundry Gateway base URL (e.g., `https://internal.devtest.truefoundry.tech/api/llm/api/inference/openai`)
- **model name for API endpoint**: Enter the endpoint model name (e.g., `openai-main/gpt-4o`)

### Step 3: Save and Test Your Configuration

1. Click **Save** to apply your configuration in Dify.

2. Create a new application or workflow to test the integration:

3. Test the integration by creating a simple LLM workflow to verify that Dify is successfully communicating with TrueFoundry's AI Gateway.
