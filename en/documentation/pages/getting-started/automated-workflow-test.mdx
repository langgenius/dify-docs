# Automated Translation Workflow Test

This document tests the new automated translation workflow that creates separate translation PRs.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic PR Creation">
    When you create a PR with English content changes, the system automatically:
    - Analyzes your changes
    - Generates translations
    - Creates a separate translation PR
    - Links both PRs together
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="PR Updates">
    When you update your original PR:
    - The translation PR is automatically updated
    - New translations are generated for your changes
    - Both PRs remain synchronized
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Benefits

<Card title="No More Manual Work" icon="magic-wand">
  The entire translation process is now fully automated - no manual sync branch merging required!
</Card>

<Card title="Clear Separation" icon="split">
  English content and translations are handled in separate PRs for better review workflow.
</Card>

## Testing Scenarios

1. **English-only changes** → Should trigger automated translation PR creation
2. **Translation-only changes** → Should skip automation and go through direct review
3. **Mixed changes** → Should block with error message and instructions

This test document will verify that the automated workflow works correctly for English content changes.
