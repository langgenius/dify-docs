# Fresh Workflow Test

This is a brand new test document to verify the automated translation workflow works end-to-end.

## Expected Workflow

1. **Analysis**: This PR should be categorized as "english" type
2. **Translation**: Execution workflow should create translations 
3. **PR Creation**: A separate translation PR should be created automatically
4. **Linking**: Both PRs should be linked with comments

## Test Content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does it work?">
    The system automatically detects English-only changes and creates corresponding translations in Chinese and Japanese.

  <Accordion title="What gets translated?">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
