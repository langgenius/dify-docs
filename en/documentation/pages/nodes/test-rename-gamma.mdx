# Test Rename Alpha

This is a test file created to validate that the rename fix works correctly.

**Expected behavior:**
1. This file will be added with name `test-rename-alpha.mdx`
2. Translation workflow will create `cn/...test-rename-alpha.mdx` and `jp/...test-rename-alpha.mdx`
3. All three language sections in docs.json will have entries
4. File will be renamed to `test-rename-beta.mdx` in next commit
5. Auto-sync should update BOTH physical files AND docs.json entries for cn/jp

## Test Details

- Initial name: test-rename-alpha.mdx
- Renamed to: test-rename-beta.mdx (step 2)
- Purpose: Validate PR#189 fix for docs.json rename bug
