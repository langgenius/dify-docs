# Rename Test Alpha

This test validates all three critical fixes for the rename bug:

## The Three Fixes

**Fix #1 - Extension Stripping (Location Lookup)**:
- Problem: `_handle_rename` looked up `"en/.../file.mdx"` but docs.json has `"en/.../file"`
- Solution: Strip `.mdx`/`.md` before location lookup
- Commit: 8bf899c6

**Fix #2 - Conditional Rename Detection**:
- Problem: Reconcile always skipped rename detection, treating R100 renames as delete+add
- Solution: Only skip when git actually detected renames
- Commit: 532e97cf

**Fix #3 - Extension Stripping (New Target)**:
- Problem: Added entries with extension like `"cn/.../file.mdx"` instead of `"cn/.../file"`
- Solution: Strip extension before adding to docs.json
- Commit: b9489a0a

## Test Plan

1. **Alpha** (this file) → Translated to cn/jp
2. **Alpha → Beta** → Validate both physical files AND docs.json entries renamed
3. **Beta → Gamma** → Validate consistency across multiple renames

## Expected Results

After each rename:
- ✅ Physical files renamed: `cn/rename-test-*.mdx`, `jp/rename-test-*.mdx`
- ✅ docs.json entries updated: `cn/.../rename-test-*` (no extension)
- ✅ NO deletions of cn/jp entries
- ✅ Entries match English structure exactly
