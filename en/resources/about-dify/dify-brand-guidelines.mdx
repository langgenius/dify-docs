---

The Dify identity is more than a logo—it's a statement of thoughtful construction, system-level clarity, and open collaboration.
When you are authorized or recognized as part of the Dify ecosystem, you represent the values we stand for.
By using Dify Brand Assets in an official or affiliate capacity, you share in the responsibility of upholding our design system and product philosophy.
Use of Dify Brand Assets must comply with our Brand Guidelines and be consistent with the principles outlined in the Dify Brand Usage Terms.
Any use that implies endorsement, partnership, or certification without explicit permission is not allowed.
Dify may revoke usage rights at any time if misuse occurs.

Refer to: [Dify Brand Usage Terms](/en/resources/about-dify/dify-brand-usage-terms).

## Using Our Logo

The Dify logo signifies more than product—it signals trust, clarity, and technical credibility.
To maintain brand integrity, it must be used in accordance with our guidelines.
Misuse or casual placement may imply endorsement or affiliation where none exists.
Please use thoughtfully and only in approved contexts.

### Examples of appropriate logo usage

- In co-branded visuals with official partners
- In event materials or pages where Dify is a sponsor or participant
- In a group of logos alongside other tools (“logo garden”)
- In documentation, presentations, or integrations referencing Dify technologies

## Use the Right Color

Whenever possible, use the official two-tone Dify logo.

This version best represents the balance between clarity and structure in our brand.

Alternative color variations may be used when:

- Background colors limit contrast
- Specific print or digital limitations apply
- Layout demands mono or reversed options

## Keep It Legible

To ensure visibility and clarity, the Dify logo must always be surrounded by a minimum area of clear space.This prevents visual interference from nearby text, images, or other graphic elements.
- More space is recommended wherever possible to enhance legibility.
- Do not crowd the logo. Respecting this spacing is essential to maintain its impact and recognizability across all applications.

When pairing the Dify logo with another brand, always follow the co-branding layout shown here to maintain clarity and balance.
- Use a thin vertical divider to separate the Dify logo from the partner brand.
- Always maintain the relative positioning and proportions between the Dify and partner logos.
- Do not rearrange the layout, change alignment, or scale elements independently.
 
## Multiple Logo Lockup Guidelines

When Dify appears alongside two or more partner logos, follow these rules to ensure clarity and visual order:

- Do not use dividers between logos.
- Maintain consistent and equal spacing between all logos.
- If the initiative is partner-led, the partner’s logo should appear first. All other logos, including Dify, should follow in alphabetical order.
- All logos must be visually aligned to the same height. Do not scale or distort individual marks.
- Preserve each brand’s official colors, adequate whitespace, and consistent spacing throughout.

## Dify Partner Badge

The Dify Partner Badge is used to indicate an official relationship with Dify.
It can be included in marketing materials, presentations, documentation, and event assets owned by the partner, as long as the content refers to Dify’s products, integrations, or support.
- Ensure minimum clear space so the design doesn't appear cluttered.
- Do not change the badge color.
- Do not change the proportions of the logo.
- Do not alter or replace the text in the badge.
- Do not make the badge bigger than the partner logo.
