Dify is a source-available platform for building AI applications. We combine Backend-as-a-Service and LLMOps to streamline the development of generative AI solutions, making it accessible to both developers and non-technical innovators.

Our platform integrates:

- Support for mainstream LLMs
- An intuitive Prompt orchestration interface
- High-quality RAG engines
- A flexible AI Agent framework
- An Intuitive Low-code Workflow
- Easy-to-use interfaces and APIs

With Dify, you can skip the complexity and focus on what matters most - creating innovative AI applications that solve real-world problems.

### The Advantage of Dify

While many AI development tools offer individual components, Dify provides a comprehensive, production-ready solution. Think of Dify as a well-designed scaffolding system, not just a toolbox.

As a source-available platform, Dify is co-created by a dedicated professional team and a vibrant community. This collaboration ensures rapid iteration, robust features, and a user-friendly interface.

With Dify, you can:

- Deploy capabilities similar to Assistants API and GPTs using any model
- Maintain full control over your data with flexible security options
- Leverage an intuitive interface for easy management and deployment
