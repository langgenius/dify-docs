Dify is an open-source platform for building AI applications. We combine Backend-as-a-Service and LLMOps to streamline the development of generative AI solutions, making it accessible to both developers and non-technical innovators.

Our platform integrates:

- Support for mainstream LLMs
- An intuitive Prompt orchestration interface
- High-quality RAG engines
- A flexible AI Agent framework
- An Intuitive Low-code Workflow
- Easy-to-use interfaces and APIs

With Dify, you can skip the complexity and focus on what matters most - creating innovative AI applications that solve real-world problems.

### The Advantage of Dify

While many AI development tools offer individual components, Dify provides a comprehensive, production-ready solution. Think of Dify as a well-designed scaffolding system, not just a toolbox.

As an open-source platform, Dify is co-created by a dedicated professional team and a vibrant community. This collaboration ensures rapid iteration, robust features, and a user-friendly interface.

With Dify, you can:

- Deploy capabilities similar to Assistants API and GPTs using any model
- Maintain full control over your data with flexible security options
- Leverage an intuitive interface for easy management and deployment

### Dify

<Info>
The name Dify comes from "Define + Modify", referring to defining and continuously improving your AI applications. For standard to complex AI application patterns, Dify Dose It For You.

Here's how various groups are leveraging Dify:

1. **Startups**: Rapidly prototype and iterate on AI ideas, accelerating both successes and failures. Numerous teams have used Dify to build MVPs, secure funding, and win customer contracts.
2. **Established Businesses**: Enhance existing applications with LLM capabilities. Use Dify's RESTful APIs to separate prompts from business logic, while utilizing our management interface to track data, costs, and usage.
3. **Enterprise AI infrastructure**: Banks and tech companies are deploying Dify as an internal LLM gateway, facilitating GenAI adoption with centralized governance.
4. **AI Enthusiasts and Learners**: Practice prompt engineering and explore agent technologies with ease. Over 60,000 developers built their first AI app on Dify even before GPTs were introduced. Since then, our community has grown significantly, now boasting over 180,000 developers and supporting 59,000+ end users.

Whether you're a startup founder, an enterprise developer, or an AI enthusiast, Dify is designed to meet your needs and accelerate your AI journey!
