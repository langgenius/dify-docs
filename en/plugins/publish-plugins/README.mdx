### Publish Methods

To accommodate the various publishing needs of developers, Dify provides three plugin publish methods:

#### **1. Marketplace**

**Introduction**: The official Dify plugin marketplace allows users to browse, search, and install a variety of plugins with just one click.

**Features**:

* Plugins become available after passing a review, ensuring they are **trustworthy** and **high-quality**.
* Can be installed directly into an individual or team **Workspaces**.

**Publication Process**:

* Submit the plugin project to the **Dify Marketplace** [code repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).
* After an official review, the plugin will be publicly released in the marketplace for other users to install and use.

* **Open-source sharing project** → **Recommended to use GitHub**, convenient for version management and community collaboration.
* **Quick distribution or internal testing** → **Recommended to use plugin file**, allowing for straightforward and efficient installation and sharing.
