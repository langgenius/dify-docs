### Background

Updating plugins that others are actively using can be tedious. Traditionally, you would need to modify code, bump versions, push changes, create branches, package files, and submit PRs manually - a repetitive process that slows down development.

Thus, we have created **Plugin Auto-PR**, a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the entire process. Now you can package, push, and create PRs with a single action, focusing on building great plugins.

### Concepts

#### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions automates your development tasks in GitHub.

**How it works**: When triggered (e.g., by a code push), it runs your workflow in a cloud-based virtual machine, handling everything from build to deployment automatically.

![Workflow](https://assets-docs.dify.ai/2025/04/60534de8e220f860947b32a8329a8349.png)

**Limits**:

* Public repositories: Unlimited
* Private repositories: 2000 minutes per month

#### Plugin Auto-PR

**How it works**:

1. Workflow triggers when you push code to the main branch of your plugin source repository
2. Workflow reads plugin information from the `manifest.yaml` file
3. Automatically packages the plugin as a `.difypkg` file
4. Pushes the packaged file to your forked `dify-plugins` repository
5. Creates a new branch and commits changes
6. Automatically creates a PR to merge into the upstream repository

### Prerequisites

#### Repository

* You already have your own plugin source code repository (e.g., `your-name/plugin-source`)
* You already have your own forked plugin repository (e.g., `your-name/dify-plugins`)
* Your forked repository already has the plugin directory structure:

```
dify-plugins/
└── your-author-name
    └── plugin-name
```

#### Permission

This workflow requires appropriate permissions to function:

* You need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with sufficient permissions
* The PAT must have permission to push code to your forked repository
* The PAT must have permission to create PRs to the upstream repository

### Parameters and Configuration

#### Setup Requirements

To get started with auto-publishing, you will need two key components:

**manifest.yaml file**: This file drives the automation process:

* `name`: Your plugin’s name (affects package and branch names)
* `version`: Semantic version number (increment with each release)
* `author`: Your GitHub username (determines repository paths)

**PLUGIN\_ACTION Secret**: You need to add this secret to your plugin source repository:

* Value: Must be a Personal Access Token (PAT) with sufficient permissions
* Permission: Ability to push branches to your forked repository and create PRs to the upstream repository

#### Automatically-Generated Parameters

Once set up, the workflow automatically handles these parameters:

* GitHub username: Read from the `author` field in `manifest.yaml`
* Author folder name: Consistent with the `author` field
* Plugin name: Read from the `name` field in `manifest.yaml`
* Branch name: `bump-{plugin-name}-plugin-{version}`
* Package filename: `{plugin-name}-{version}.difypkg`
* PR title and content: Automatically generated based on plugin name and version

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Repositories">
    Ensure you have forked the official `dify-plugins` repository and have your own plugin source repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Secret">
    Navigate to your plugin source repository, click **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret**, and create a GitHub Secret:

    * Name: `PLUGIN_ACTION`
    * Value: GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with write permissions to the target repository (`your-name/dify-plugins`)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Workflow File">
    Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository, create a file named `plugin-publish.yml` in this directory, and copy the following content into the file:

    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/auto-pr.yml

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]  # Trigger on push to main

  </Step>
  <Step title="Update manifest.yaml">
    Ensure those following fields are correctly set:

    ```yaml
    version: 0.0.x  # Version number
    author: your-github-username  # GitHub username/Author name
    name: your-plugin-name  # Plugin name
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Usage Guide

#### First-time Setup

When setting up the auto-publish workflow for the first time, complete these steps:

1. Ensure you have forked the official `dify-plugins` repository
2. Ensure your plugin source repository structure is correct
3. Set up the `PLUGIN_ACTION Secret` in your plugin source repository
4. Create the workflow file `.github/workflows/plugin-publish.yml`
5. Ensure the `name` and `author` fields in the `manifest.yaml` file are correctly configured

#### Subsequent Update

To publish new versions after setup:

1. Modify the code
2. Update the `version` field in `manifest.yaml`

![Release](https://assets-docs.dify.ai/2025/04/9eed2b9110e91e18008b399e58198f03.png)

3. Push all changes to the main branch
4. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete packaging, branch creation, and PR submission

### Outcome

When you push code to the main branch of your plugin source repository, GitHub Actions will automatically execute the publishing process:

* Package the plugin in `{plugin-name}-{version}.difypkg` format
* Push the packaged file to the target repository
* Create a PR to merge into the fork repository
