    This permission controls who can install and manage plugins in the system. Options:

    * **Everyone**: Allows all users in the Workspace to install and manage plugins
    * **Admins**: Only Workspace administrators can install and manage plugins
    * **No one**: No one is allowed to install and manage plugins
*   **Plugin Debug Permissions**

    This permission controls who can perform plugin debugging work. Options:

    * **Everyone**: Allows all users in the Workspace to debug plugins
    * **Admins**: Only Workspace administrators can debug plugins
