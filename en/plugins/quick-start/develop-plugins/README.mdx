### **Quick Start**

You can quickly understand how to develop different types of plugins and master the functional components involved in plugin development through these development examples:

</Card>

Using the **Google Search** tool as an example to demonstrate how to develop tool-type plugins. For more details, please take refer to the following:

</Card>

By examining the **Anthropic** and **Xinference** models, we present separate guides on how to develop predefined model plugins and custom model plugins.

* Predefined models are pre-trained and validated, typically commercial models (such as the GPT series and Claude series models). These models can be utilized directly to accomplish specific tasks without additional training or configuration.
* Custom model plugins enable developers to integrate privately trained or specifically configured models tailored to meet local needs.

For development examples, refer to the following content:

Extension plugins enable developers to package business code as plugins and automatically provide an Endpoint request entry, functioning akin to an API service hosted on the Dify platform. For more details please take refer to:
