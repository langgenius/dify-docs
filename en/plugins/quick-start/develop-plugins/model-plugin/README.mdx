Model type plugins enable the Dify platform to request models from specific model providers. For example, after installing the OpenAI model plugin, the Dify platform can request models like GPT-4, GPT-4o-2024-05-13, etc., provided by OpenAI.

### **Model Plugin Structure**

To better understand the concepts involved in developing plugin models, here's an example structure within model type plugins:

* Model Provider: Large model development companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
* Model Categories: Depending on the provider, categories include Large Language Models (LLM), Text Embedding models, Speech-to-Text models, etc.
* Specific Models: `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `gpt-4-turbo`, etc.

Code structure in plugin projects:

```bash
- Model Provider
  - Model Category
    - Specific Models
```

Taking Anthropic as an example, the model plugin structure looks like this:

```bash
- Anthropic
  - llm
    claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
    claude-3-haiku-20240307
    claude-3-opus-20240229
    claude-3-sonnet-20240229
    claude-instant-1.2
    claude-instant-1
```

Taking OpenAI as an example, which supports multiple model types:

```bash
├── models
│ ├── llm
│ │ ├── chatgpt-4o-latest
│ │ ├── gpt-3.5-turbo
│ │ ├── gpt-4-0125-preview
│ │ ├── gpt-4-turbo
│ │ ├── gpt-4o
│ │ ├── llm
│ │ ├── o1-preview
│ │ └── text-davinci-003
│ ├── moderation
│ │ ├── moderation
│ │ └── text-moderation-stable
│ ├── speech2text
│ │ ├── speech2text
│ │ └── whisper-1
│ ├── text_embedding
│ │ ├── text-embedding-3-large
│ │ └── text_embedding
│ └── tts
│ ├── tts-1-hd
│ ├── tts-1
│ └── tts
```
