Before start to develop Dify plugins, please prepare the following prerequisites:
* [Dify Plugin CLI tool](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon?tab=readme-ov-file#cli)
* [Python 3.12+](https://docs.python.org/3.12/using/index.html)

## **1. Install Dify Plugin CLI Tool**

The Dify Plugin CLI Tool can be installed either with from Homebrew (on Linux and macOS) or with the standalone binary executable file (on Windows, Linux and macOS).

### Install with Homebrew

For the macOS and Linux users, installing Dify Plugin CLI with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended.

Tap the [Homebrew formula for Dify Plugin CLI tool](https://github.com/langgenius/homebrew-dify), and then install it with `brew install`.

```bash
brew tap langgenius/dify
brew install dify
```

To check the installation, run `dify version` and a version code should be displayed.
```bash
dify version
```

To upgrade the Dify Plugin CLI tool, run the following command:

```bash
brew upgrade dify
```

### Install with binary executable

**Download the binary executable:**

On the asset list of the release page of [Dify Plugin CLI Tool](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases), choose and download the binary executable for the OS system (Linux / macOS / Windows) and the chip architecture (`amd64` for x86 chips / `arm64` for ARM or Apple's M chips).

Using **macOS with M chips** as an example. Download the `dify-plugin-darwin-arm64` file and grant it execution permissions by running the command:
```bash
chmod +x ./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
mv ./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 ./dify
```

To check the installation, run `./dify version` and a version code should be displayed.
```bash
./dify version
```

> If the system shows an "Apple cannot verify" error, go to **Settings → Privacy & Security → Security**, and click the "Open Anyway" button.

<Info>
    **Tips:**
    To use `dify` command globally system-wide, it's recommended to rename the binary file to `dify` and copy it to the
    `/usr/local/bin` system path.
