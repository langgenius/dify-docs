## 👋 Welcome to Dify 101

We are going to take you from Zero to Hero. By the end of this course, you will build your very own Advanced AI Email Assistant.

Let's leave coding behind for a second and talk about cooking. 

Imagine you want to cook a dish that you haven’t made before. To make that happen, you need a **Recipe**. A recipe is just like a workflow! It tells you exactly what to do, in what order, to get the dish you want.

## Meet Workflow
In Dify, you are the head chef who writes a Recipe for the AI to follow. Here’re the things you need to 

1. Input (Ingredients): The information you give the AI. This could be a user's question, a PDF document, or a messy email draft.
2. Process (Instructions): The steps you force the AI to take. For example: "First, summarize this text. Next, translate it into Spanish. Finally, format it as a LinkedIn post."
3. Output (The Dish): The final result the AI hands back to you.

To sum up, a workflow is a flowchart that asks AI to complete tasks in a specific order.

This is a Smart ID Scanner workflow. Its job is to extract the information on front and back of an ID card, then send these texts back to you.

## Node
Let's have a closer look of the workflow above. That whole process is simply made up of a few connected steps: **Uploading the image, Extracting the information, and Combining the results**.

Each of these steps is called a **Node**.

Think of them like runners in a relay race: each node has a specific task. Once it finishes its turn, it passes the baton to the next node in line.

Dify offers you a box of ready-to-use nodes, such as the LLM, Knowledge Retrieval, If/Else, Tools, etc. You can connect these nodes just by dragging and dropping—it's like building with the Lego blocks! You can easily snap them together to create a powerful automated workflow.

## It's Your Turn
