# Test Workflow Validation

This is a test file created to validate that the translation workflow works correctly after refactoring the codebase to be fully config-driven.

## Purpose

This file tests:
- **New file addition**: Translation workflow should detect this file and create zh/ja versions
- **Config-driven language codes**: All hardcoded `cn`/`jp` references replaced with `zh`/`ja` from config.json
- **Source language abstraction**: System now uses "source language" instead of hardcoded "English"

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is created, the GitHub Actions workflow should:

1. Detect this new file in `en/use-dify/getting-started/`
2. Translate it to Chinese (zh) and Japanese (ja) using the Dify API
3. Add the translated files to the corresponding locations
4. Update docs.json for all language sections

## Test Coverage

This kitchen sink PR includes:
- ✅ New file addition (this file)
- ✅ File modification (introduction.mdx)
- ✅ docs.json navigation update

## Verification Steps

After the workflow completes:
1. Check for `zh/use-dify/getting-started/test-workflow-validation.mdx`
2. Check for `ja/use-dify/getting-started/test-workflow-validation.mdx`
3. Verify docs.json has been updated for all language sections
4. Confirm translations are accurate and include AI notice
