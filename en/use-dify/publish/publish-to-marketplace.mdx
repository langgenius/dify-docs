Publish your apps as templates to Dify Marketplace, where other Dify users can discover and use them. 

## Submit Templates

To publish a template, submit it for review first. Once approved, it will be listed on Marketplace.

<Note>
    Before submission, make sure all plugins used in the app are installed directly from Marketplace.

There are two ways to submit:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="From Dify Studio">
        In your app, click **Publish** > **Publish to Marketplace**.
    
        This takes you to the [Creator Center](https://creators.dify.ai) where you can fill in the template details and submit for review.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="In the Creator Center">
    Export your app, then go to the [Creator Center](https://creators.dify.ai) and upload the export file. Fill in the template details and submit for review.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Template Writing Guidelines

### Language Requirements

Keep the template library consistent and searchable.

**The following fields must be written in English**:

    - Template name
    - Overview
    - Setup steps

**Inside the app, you can use any language (e.g. Chinese) for**:

    - Node names
    - Prompts / system messages
    - Messages shown to end-users

If your template mainly targets non-English users, you can add a tag in the title. For example,
Stock Investment Analysis Copilot [ZH].

### Template Name & Icon

From the name alone, users should know where it runs and what it does.

- Use a short English phrase, typically 3-7 words.
- Recommended pattern: [Channel / target] + [core task], for example:
    - WeChat Customer Support Bot
    - CSV Data Analyzer with Natural Language
    - Internal Docs Q&A Assistant
    - GitHub Issue Triage Agent
- Include keywords users might search for: channel names (Slack, WeChat, Email, Notion) and task names (Summarizer, Assistant, Generator, Bot).

### Categories

Help users discover your template when browsing or filtering by category.

- Select only 1-3 categories that best describe your template.
- Do not check every category just for exposure.

### Language

Help users discover your template via language filters.

- Select the language(s) your template is designed for in real usage.
- This refers to the language of the template's use case, input, or output — **not** the title or overview (which must be in English).

### Overview

In 2-4 English sentences, explain what it does and who it is for.

<info>You don't need to list prerequisites, inputs, or outputs here.</info>

**Recommended structure**

1. Sentence 1: What it does
    A one-sentence summary of the main function.
2. Sentence 2-3: Who and when
    Typical user roles or scenarios (support team, marketers, founders, individual knowledge workers, etc.).

<Accordion title="Example: Description for Stock Investment Analysis Copilot"> 

This template creates a stock investment analysis copilot that uses Yahoo Finance tools to fetch news, analytics, and ticker data for any listed company.

It helps investors and analysts quickly generate structured research summaries, compare companies, and prepare reports without manually switching between multiple finance websites.

</Accordion>

### Setup Steps

Write Setup steps as a numbered Markdown list (1., 2., 3.), with one short sentence per step, starting with a verb.

A new user should be able to get the template running in a few minutes just by following these steps.

**Writing principles**

1. Follow the real setup order, usually:
    1. Use/import the template
    2. Connect accounts / add API keys
    3. Connect data sources (docs, databases, sheets, etc.)
    4. Optional customization (assistant name, tone, filters)
    5. Activate the workflow and run a test

2. Each step should answer:
    - Where to click in the UI
    - What to configure or fill in

3. Aim for 3-8 steps. Too few feels incomplete; too many feels overwhelming.

<Accordion title="Example: Setup Steps for Stock Investment Analysis Copilot (Yahoo Finance tools) ">
    1. Click **Use template** to copy the “Investment Analysis Copilot (Yahoo Finance)” agent into your workspace.

    2. Go to **Settings → Model provider** and add your LLM API key. For example, OpenAI, Anthropic, or another supported provider.

    3. Open the agent's **Orchestrate** page and make sure the Yahoo Finance tools are enabled in the **Tools** section:
        - `yahoo Analytics`
        - `yahoo News`
        - `yahoo Ticker`

    4. (Optional) Customize the analysis style:
        - In the **INSTRUCTIONS** area, adjust the system prompt to match your target users. For example, tone, report length, preferred language, or risk preference.
        - Update the suggested questions in the **Debug & Preview** panel if you want different example queries.

    5. Click **Publish** to make the agent available, then use the preview panel to test it:
        - Enter a company name or ticker (e.g., `Nvidia`, `AAPL`, `TSLA`).
        - Confirm that the copilot calls the Yahoo Finance tools and returns a structured investment analysis report.
