You've built something great in Dify. Now let's get it to your users. Every Dify application becomes available in multiple ways automatically—choose what works best for your situation.

## Start with Web Apps

Your fastest path to sharing is through web apps. These are generated automatically when you create any application and work immediately without setup.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hit Publish">
    Click "Publish" in your app to activate the latest version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the URL">
    Find your web app link in the publish section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share immediately">
    Send the link to users—they can start using your app right away.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Web apps work on any device and automatically adapt to screen sizes. No app store approvals or installation required.

## How Publishing Works

When you publish an app, Dify creates a web app and API endpoint with your latest configuration:

- **Web apps** update immediately with new features and responses
- **API endpoints** serve the latest model and workflow configurations
- **Website embeds** (which display your web app) automatically reflect all changes
- **MCP servers** provide access to current app capabilities

<Warning>
Publishing replaces your live app with the current configuration. Users will immediately see changes in their next interaction.
</Warning>

## Choose Your Approach

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I want immediate user feedback">
    Use **Web Apps**. Share a link and start collecting feedback within minutes. Perfect for validating ideas or serving non-technical users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm building a product">
    Use **API Integration**. You control the interface, user authentication, and data handling. Your app becomes part of your product ecosystem.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I have an existing website">
    Use **Embed on Websites**. Display your web app as a chat widget or inline frame on your current site. Works with any website technology.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I want to extend AI tools">
    Use **MCP Server**. Make your app available to Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other AI development environments as a native tool.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Publishing Best Practices

Before you share your app, ensure you've configured these settings:

- **App description** - Helps users understand what your app does
- **Icon and branding** - Makes your app recognizable and professional
- **Access controls** - Decide if your app should be public or require authentication
- **Rate limits** - Protect your app from overuse (especially important for API access)

<Check>
All publishing methods use the same app configuration. Set it once, publish everywhere.
