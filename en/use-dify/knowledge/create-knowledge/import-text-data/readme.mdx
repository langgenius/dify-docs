title: Upload Local Files
---

<Note>
    Once a knowledge base is created, its data source cannot be changed later.
</Note>

When quick-creating a knowledge base, you can upload local files as its data source:

1. Click **Knowledge** > **Create Knowledge**.

2. Select **Import from file** as the data source, then upload your files.

    - Maximum file size: 15 MB

    - Maximum number of files per upload: 5

    <Info>
        On Dify Cloud, **batch uploading** is only available on [the **Professional** and **Team** plans](https://dify.ai/pricing).

**For Images in Uploaded Files**

    JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF images under 2 MB are automatically extracted as attachments to their corresponding chunks. These images can be managed independently and are returned alongside their chunks during retrieval. 

    <Tip>
        For self-hosted deployments, you can adjust the size limit via the environment variable `ATTACHMENT_IMAGE_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT`.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
        Each chunk supports up to 10 image attachments; images beyond this limit will not be extracted.

        For self-hosted deployments, you can adjust this limit via the environment variable `SINGLE_CHUNK_ATTACHMENT_LIMIT`.
    </Note>

    The above extraction rule applies to:

    - Images embedded in DOCX files

        <Note>
            Images embedded in other file types (e.g., PDF) can only be extracted by using appropriate document extraction plugins in [knowledge pipelines](/en/use-dify/knowledge/knowledge-pipeline/readme).
        </Note>

    - Images referenced via accessible URLs using the following Markdown syntax in any file type:

        - `![alt text](image_url)`
        - `![alt text](image_url "optional title")`

    <Tip>
        If you select a multimodal embedding model (indicated by the **Vision** icon) in subsequent index settings, the extracted images will be embedded and indexed for retrieval.
