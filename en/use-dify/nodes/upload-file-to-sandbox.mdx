description: "Upload multimodal files to the sandbox so LLMs can process them with tools and scripts—even file types they can't handle natively"

<Info>
    This node is only available in applications using the sandboxed runtime.
</Info>

When files are passed directly to an LLM, processing is limited by the model's own multimodal capabilities. While the [Doc Extractor](/en/use-dify/nodes/doc-extractor) node can convert various file types to text for LLMs to better process, its supported formats are still limited.

This is where the Upload File to Sandbox node helps. Once files are uploaded, downstream [Agent nodes](/en/use-dify/nodes/agent#sandboxed-runtime) (with **Agent Mode** enabled) can execute commands to install tools and run scripts as needed, converting files into formats LLMs can process.

<Info>
    - Processing results depends on the model's reasoning capability.
    - In production, these uploaded files are scoped to each run and do not persist in the sandbox.

**How to use:**

1. In an Upload File to Sandbox node, select a file variable (e.g., from User Input). Both `file` and `array[file]` data types are supported.

2. In a downstream Agent node's prompt, reference the `sandbox_path` and `file_name` variables so the model can locate and process the file. For example:

    ```bash wrap
    # System instruction
    You are a data analyst. Analyze uploaded data files and provide insights.

    # User message
    Analyze the data in "{{Upload File to Sandbox.file_name}}" at {{Upload File to Sandbox.sandbox_path}}.
    ```

    <Info>
        The `file_name` variable also includes the file extension (e.g., `data.csv`).
