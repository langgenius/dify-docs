**To add and configure a tool node:**

1. On the canvas, click **Add Node** > **Tools**, then select an action from an available tool or install a new tool plugin from Marketplace.

2. (Optional) If a tool requires authentication, click **Connect credentials to continue** and choose an authorization method:

    - **Workspace Credential**: Select an existing credential or create a new one. Your end users won't need to authorize manually.

        <Info>
          To change the default, go to the **Tools** or **Plugins** page.
        </Info>

    - **End-user Credential**: Require end users to provide their own credentials when using the app.

3. Complete any other required tool settings.
