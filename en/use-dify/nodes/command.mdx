While Agent nodes can execute commands autonomously, Command nodes are better when you know exactly what command to run and don't need LLM reasoning. They're faster and don't consume tokens.

Commands run in the root directory by default. To use a different working directory, type an existing path or one that will be created by upstream nodes during execution.
