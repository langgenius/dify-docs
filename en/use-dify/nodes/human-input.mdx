The Human Input node pauses workflows at key points to request human input before execution continues.

When execution reaches this node, a customizable request form is delivered through specific channels. Recipients can provide input, review data, and choose from predefined decisions that determine how the workflow proceeds.

By embedding human judgement directly where it matters, you can **balance automated efficiency with human oversight**.

## Configuration

Configure the following to define how the node requests and processes human input:

- **Delivery method**: How the request form reaches recipients.

- **Form content**: What information recipients will see and what they can input.

- **User action**: What decisions recipients can make and how the workflow proceeds accordingly.

- **Timeout strategy**: How long to wait and what happens if no recipient responds.

### Delivery Method

Choose the channel through which the request is delivered. Currently available methods:

- **Web app**: Displays the request form directly in the web app interface for the current user to respond.

- **Email**: Sends an email containing the request link to one or more recipients.

<Note>
    The request closes after the first response regardless of delivery method.
</Note>

### Form Content

Customize what appears in the request form:

- Format and structure the content using **Markdown** syntax

- Reference available **variables** to display dynamic data

    <Tip>
        If you reference the `text` output variable from a reasoning model, the form will display the model's thinking process along with the final answer. 
    
        To show only the answer, toggle on **Enable Reasoning Tag Separation** for the corresponding LLM node.
    </Tip>

- Add interactive **input fields** where recipients can provide input or make edits

    <Info>
        Input fields can be pre-filled with variables or static content that recipients can edit. 
    
        Each input field becomes an output variable for use in downstream nodes.
    </Info>

### User Action

Define the decision buttons that recipients can click.

Each button creates a corresponding branch from the Human Input node, routing execution based on the decision made.

For example, a `Post` branch might lead to nodes that trigger content publishing, while a `Regenerate` branch might loop back to an LLM node to revise the content.

<Tip>
    Use preset button styles to visually distinguish actions. 
    
    For example, use a prominent style for key actions like `Approve` and a subtler one for secondary options.
</Tip>

### Timeout Strategy

Configure how long to wait for a response before the request expires.

If no recipient responds within the set time, the workflow automatically ends unless you define a fallback branch to handle the timeout—for example, send a notification or retry the request.
