### Form Content

Customize what appears in the request form:

- Format and structure the content using **Markdown** syntax.

- Reference available **variables** to display dynamic data.

  For example, reference an LLM node's output to show AI-generated content that recipients can review.

    <Tip>
        If you reference the `text` output variable from a reasoning model, the form will display the model's thinking process along with the final answer. 
    
        To show only the answer, toggle on **Enable Reasoning Tag Separation** for the corresponding LLM node.
    </Tip>

- Add interactive **input fields** to collect information from recipients.

  Input fields can be pre-filled with variables (to show suggested content) or static text (to provide examples or default values). Recipients can edit the pre-filled content or leave it unchanged.

  Each input field becomes an variable that can be referenced in downstream nodes to incorporate recipient input. For example, pass edited content to a publishing node or send feedback to an LLM node for regeneration.
