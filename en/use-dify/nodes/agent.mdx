### Form Content

Customize what appears in the request form.

- **Format and structure with Markdown**

  Use headings, lists, bold text, links, and other Markdown elements to present information clearly.

- **Display dynamic data with variables**

  Reference an LLM node's output that recipients can review, or provide any workflow data as context for more informed decisions.

    <Tip>
        If you reference the `text` output variable from a reasoning model, the form will display the model's thinking process along with the final answer.
    
        To show only the answer, toggle on **Enable Reasoning Tag Separation** for the corresponding LLM node.
    </Tip>

- **Collect input with input fields**

  Input fields can be empty, or pre-filled with variables (e.g., AI-generated text to refine) or static text (e.g., example responses or default values) that recipients can edit.

  Each input field becomes an variable that downstream nodes can reference. For example, pass edited content to a publishing node or send feedback to an LLM node for regeneration.
