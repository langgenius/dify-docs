### Form Content

Customize what appears in the request form:

- **Format and structure with Markdown**

  Use headings, lists, bold text, links, and other Markdown elements to present information clearly.

- **Display dynamic data with variables**

  Reference workflow variables to show dynamic content, such as AI-generated text for review or any contextual information that informs recipient decisions.

    <Tip>
        If you reference the `text` output variable from a reasoning model, the form will display the model's thinking process along with the final answer.
    
        To show only the answer, toggle on **Enable Reasoning Tag Separation** for the corresponding LLM node.
    </Tip>

- **Collect input with input fields**

  Input fields can start empty or pre-filled with variables (e.g., LLM output to refine) or static text (e.g., example or default values) that recipients can edit.

  Each input field becomes a variable for downstream use. For instance, pass edited content for further processing or send feedback to an LLM for regeneration.

### User Action

Define the decision buttons that recipients can click. Each button corresponds to a separate execution branch.

For example, a `Post` branch might lead to nodes that trigger content publishing, while a `Regenerate` branch might loop back to an LLM node to revise the content.

<Tip>
    Use preset button styles to visually distinguish actions. 
    
    For example, use a prominent style for key actions like `Approve` and a subtler one for secondary options.
