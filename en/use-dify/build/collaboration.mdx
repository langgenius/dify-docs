Workspace members with editor permissions or above can edit the same workflow simultaneously. Right-click the canvas and select **Add Comment** to share ideas.

To add multiple comments faster, press `C` to enter comment mode. If you `@`mention others in comments, they'll be notified by email. 

<Info>
    For self-hosted deployments, collaboration is disabled by default. To enable it, set these environment variables:

    - `ENABLE_COLLABORATION_MODE` = `true`
    - `SERVER_WORKER_CLASS` = `geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker`

    When deploying with a custom domain, also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` to your WebSocket server URL.
