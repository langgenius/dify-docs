Tools enable your AI apps to interact with external services and APIs—so they can access real-time data and perform actions (e.g., web searches, database queries, or content processing).

Each tool defines a clear interface: what inputs it accepts, what action it performs, and what output it returns. This helps LLMs decide when and how to call a tool based on user requests.

You can integrate tools into:

- [Workflows / Chatflows](/en/use-dify/nodes/tools) (as standalone nodes)

- [LLM nodes](/en/use-dify/nodes/llm)

- [Agents](/en/use-dify/build/agent)

All your tools can be managed centrally on the **Tools** page.

## Tool Types

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Tool Plugin">

        Tool [plugins](/en/use-dify/build/plugin) are ready-to-use integrations provided by Dify and the community for common utilities and popular third-party services.

        In addition to built-in tool plugins (like CurrentTime and WebScraper) available out of the box, you can explore and install more from [Dify Marketplace](https://marketplace.dify.ai/).

        **Manage Authorization**

        Many tool plugins (e.g., Google and GitHub) require authentication—such as API keys or OAuth—before use.

        You can manage workspace-level credentials for these tools from the **Tools** or **Plugins** page or directly within the tool settings inside an app or node.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Custom Tool">

        You can integrate external services as custom tools using a standard OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. This is ideal for connecting Dify to internal systems or third-party services not available as plugins.

        Simply paste your OpenAPI schema, import it from a URL, or start from a provided example—Dify will parse the spec and generate the tool interface automatically.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Workflow Tool">
        
        You can make any workflow starting with a User Input node available as a tool.

        This allows you to encapsulate complex, multi-step logic into a single function that can be easily reused across different Dify apps.
    
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="MCP Tool">

        Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI apps to external data sources and tools. MCP servers expose specific capabilities (like database queries or file operations) through MCP.

        By connecting an MCP server to Dify, you can import its exposed capabilities directly as tools and refresh the tool list at any time.
