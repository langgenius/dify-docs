### 1. Not receiving reset password emails

You need to configure the `Mail` parameters in the `.env` file. For detailed instructions, please refer to ["Environment Variables Explanation: Mail-related configuration"](/en/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments#mail-related-configuration).

After modifying the configuration, run the following commands to restart the service:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

If you still haven't received the email, please check if the email service is working properly and whether the email has been placed in the trash list.

### 2. How to handle if the workflow is too complex and exceeds the node limit?

In the community edition, you can manually adjust the MAX\_TREE\_DEPTH limit for single branch depth in `web/app/components/workflow/constants.ts.` Our default value is 50, and it's important to note that excessively deep branches may affect performance in self-hosted scenarios.

### 3. How to specify the runtime for each workflow node?

You can modify the `TEXT_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` variable in the `.env` file to adjust the runtime for each node. This helps prevent overall application service unavailability caused by certain processes timing out.

### 4. How to reset the password of the admin account?

If you deployed using Docker Compose, you can reset the password with the following command while your Docker Compose is running:

```
docker exec -it docker-api-1 flask reset-password
```

It will prompt you to enter the email address and the new password. Example:

```bash
dify@my-pc:~/hello/dify/docker$ docker compose up -d

### 5. How to Change the Port

If you're using Docker Compose, you can customize the access port by modifying the `.env` configuration file.

You need to modify the Nginx configuration:

```json
EXPOSE_NGINX_PORT=80
EXPOSE_NGINX_SSL_PORT=443
```

Other self-host issue please check this document [Self-Host Related](/en/learn-more/faq/install-faq)。

### 6. How to resolve database connection errors in docker-api-1?

**Issue Details**: When accessing `http://localhost`, you may encounter an `Internal Server Error`; and the following message might appear in the `docker-api-1` logs:

```bash
FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host "172.19.0.7", user "postgres", database "dify", no encryption
```

**Solution**: Update the `/var/lib/postgresql/pgdata/pg_hba.conf` file inside the db container to allow connections from the network segment mentioned in the error message. For example:

```bash
docker exec -it docker-db-1 sh -c "echo 'host all all 172.19.0.0/16 trust' >> /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata/pg_hba.conf"
docker-compose restart
```

### 7. How to change the file size limit for knowledge base uploads?

Modify the `UPLOAD_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` parameter in the `.env` file to adjust the default limit. Additionally, you should also sync the `NGINX_CLIENT_MAX_BODY_SIZE` parameter value to avoid potential issues.
