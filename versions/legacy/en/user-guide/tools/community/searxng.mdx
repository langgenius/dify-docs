title: SearXNG
---

SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from various search services and databases. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. Now you can use this tool directly in Dify.

> If you want to use SearXNG within the Dify cloud service, please refer to the [SearXNG installation documentation](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation.html) to set up your own service, then return to Dify and fill in the service's Base URL in the "Tools > SearXNG > Authenticate" page.

## 1. Modify Dify Configuration File

The configuration file is located at `dify/api/core/tools/provider/builtin/searxng/docker/settings.yml`, and you can refer to the config documentation [here](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/settings/index.html).

## 2. Start the Service

Start the Docker container in the dify root directory.

```bash
cd dify
docker run --rm -d -p 8081:8080 -v "${PWD}/api/core/tools/provider/builtin/searxng/docker:/etc/searxng" searxng/searxng
```

## 3. Use SearXNG

Fill in the access address in "Tools > SearXNG > Authenticate" to establish a connection between the Dify service and the SearXNG service. The Docker internal address for SearXNG is usually `http://host.docker.internal:8081`.
