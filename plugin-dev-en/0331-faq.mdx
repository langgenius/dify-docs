Use this FAQ to keep momentum when questions pop up. Each answer covers the fastest way to diagnose issues and restore a smooth developer experience.

## What should I do if the plugin upload fails during installation?

**Error Details**: An error message `PluginDaemonBadRequestError: plugin_unique_identifier is not valid` appears.

**Solution**: Modify the `author` field in the `manifest.yaml` file under the plugin project and the `.yaml` file under the `/provider` path to your GitHub ID.

Rerun the plugin packaging command and install the new plugin package.

## How should I handle exceptions encountered during plugin installation?

**Problem Description**: An exception message is encountered during plugin installation: `plugin verification has been enabled, and the plugin you want to install has a bad signature`. How should this be handled?

**Solution**: Add the field `FORCE_VERIFYING_SIGNATURE=false` to the end of the `/docker/.env` configuration file. Then, run the following commands to restart the Dify service:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

After adding this field, the Dify platform will allow the installation of all plugins not listed (reviewed) on the Dify Marketplace, which may pose security risks.

It is recommended to install plugins in a testing/sandbox environment first and confirm their safety before installing them in a production environment.
