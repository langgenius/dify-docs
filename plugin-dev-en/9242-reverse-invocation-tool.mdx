title: Reverse Invocation for Tools
description: This document details how plugins can reverse invoke Tool services within
  the Dify platform. It covers three types of tool invocation methods calling installed
  tools (Built-in Tool), calling Workflow as Tool, and calling custom tools (Custom
  Tool). Each method includes corresponding entry points and interface parameter descriptions.
---

Sometimes your plugin needs to orchestrate other capabilities on demand. Use this reference to call built-in tools, workflow-as-a-tool experiences, or custom integrations without leaving your codebase.

Reverse invoking a Tool means that a plugin can call other tool-type plugins within the Dify platform. If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts of reverse invocation, please first read [Reverse Invocation of Dify Services](/plugin-dev-en/9241-reverse-invocation.mdx).

Consider the following scenarios:

*   A tool-type plugin has implemented a function, but the result is not as expected, requiring post-processing of the data.
*   A task requires a web scraper, and you want the flexibility to choose the scraping service.
*   You need to aggregate results from multiple tools, but it's difficult to handle using a Workflow application.

In these cases, you need to call other existing tools within your plugin. These tools might be from the marketplace, a self-built Workflow as a Tool, or a custom tool.

These requirements can be met by calling the `self.session.tool` field of the plugin.

### Calling Installed Tools

Allows the plugin to call various tools installed in the current Workspace, including other tool-type plugins.

**Entry Point**

```python
    self.session.tool
```

**Interface**

```python
    def invoke_builtin_tool(
        self, provider: str, tool_name: str, parameters: dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Generator[ToolInvokeMessage, None, None]:
        pass
```

Here, `provider` is the plugin ID plus the tool provider name, formatted like `langgenius/google/google`. `tool_name` is the specific tool name, and `parameters` are the arguments passed to the tool.

### Calling Workflow as Tool

For more information on Workflow as Tool, please refer to the [Tool Plugin documentation](/plugin-dev-en/0222-tool-plugin.mdx). (Note: Original link `/plugin-dev-zh/9223-tool` does not exist in English list, linked to closest match).

**Entry Point**

```python
    self.session.tool
```

**Interface**

```python
    def invoke_workflow_tool(
        self, provider: str, tool_name: str, parameters: dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Generator[ToolInvokeMessage, None, None]:
        pass
```

In this case, `provider` is the ID of this tool, and `tool_name` is specified during the creation of the tool.

### Calling Custom Tool

**Entry Point**

```python
    self.session.tool
```

**Interface**

```python
    def invoke_api_tool(
        self, provider: str, tool_name: str, parameters: dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Generator[ToolInvokeMessage, None, None]:
        pass
```

Here, `provider` is the ID of this tool, and `tool_name` is the `operation_id` from the OpenAPI specification. If it doesn't exist, it's the `tool_name` automatically generated by Dify, which can be found on the tool management page.
