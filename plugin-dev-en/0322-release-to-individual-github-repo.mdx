description: This document provides detailed instructions on how to publish Dify plugins
  to a personal GitHub repository, including preparation work, initializing a local
  plugin repository, connecting to a remote repository, uploading plugin files, packaging

Publishing from your own GitHub repository lets you move fast, collaborate in the open, and deliver updates on your schedule. Follow this workflow to package your plugin, version it responsibly, and make installation seamless for your audience.

### Publish Methods

To accommodate the various publishing needs of developers, Dify provides three plugin publish methods:

#### **1. Marketplace**

**Introduction**: The official Dify plugin marketplace allows users to browse, search, and install a variety of plugins with just one click.

**Features**:

* Plugins become available after passing a review, ensuring they are **trustworthy** and **high-quality**.
* Can be installed directly into an individual or team **Workspaces**.

**Publication Process**:

* Submit the plugin project to the **Dify Marketplace** [code repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).
* After an official review, the plugin will be publicly released in the marketplace for other users to install and use.

* Suitable for **private plugins** or **internal testing**.

**Publication Process**:

* Package the plugin project as a local file.
* Click **Upload Plugin** on the Dify plugin page and select the local file to install the plugin.
