title: Bundle Plugins for Reverse Invocation
description: This document introduces the concept and development method of Bundle
  plugin packages. Bundle plugin packages can aggregate multiple plugins together,
  supporting three types (Marketplace, GitHub, and Package). The document details
  the entire process of creating a Bundle project, adding different types of dependencies,
  and packaging the Bundle project.

A bundle plugin is the fastest way to deliver a curated toolkit. Use this guide to package multiple capabilities together, streamline installation, and tailor offerings for different customer segments.

A Bundle plugin package is a collection of multiple plugins. It allows packaging several plugins within a single plugin, enabling batch installation and providing more powerful services.

You can use the Dify CLI tool to package multiple plugins into a Bundle. Bundle plugin packages come in three types:

*   `Marketplace` type. Stores the plugin's ID and version information. During import, the specific plugin package will be downloaded from the Dify Marketplace.
*   `GitHub` type. Stores the GitHub repository address, release version number, and asset filename. During import, Dify will access the corresponding GitHub repository to download the plugin package.
*   `Package` type. The plugin package is stored directly within the Bundle. It does not store reference sources, but this might lead to a larger Bundle package size.

### Prerequisites

*   Dify plugin scaffolding tool
*   Python environment, version â‰¥ 3.10

For detailed instructions on how to prepare the plugin development scaffolding tool, please refer to [Initialize Development Tools](/plugin-dev-en/0221-initialize-development-tools).

### Create a Bundle Project

From your workspace, run `dify bundle init` to scaffold the project. Installation paths and binary aliases are documented in [Dify CLI Essentials](/plugin-dev-en/0111-cli) if you need a refresher.

#### 1. Fill in Plugin Information

Follow the prompts to configure the plugin name, author information, and plugin description. If you are collaborating as a team, you can also enter the organization name as the author.

> The name must be 1-128 characters long and can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

After filling in the information and pressing Enter, the Bundle plugin project directory will be automatically created.

#### 2. Add Dependencies

*   **Marketplace**

Execute the following command:

```bash
dify-plugin bundle append marketplace . --marketplace_pattern=langgenius/openai:0.0.1
```

Where `marketplace_pattern` is the reference to the plugin in the marketplace, in the format `organization_name/plugin_name:version_number`.

*   **Github**

Execute the following command:

```bash
dify-plugin bundle append github . --repo_pattern=langgenius/openai:0.0.1/openai.difypkg
```

Where `repo_pattern` is the reference to the plugin on GitHub, in the format `organization_name/repository_name:release/asset_name`.

*   **Package**

Execute the following command:

```bash
dify-plugin bundle append package . --package_path=./openai.difypkg
```

Where `package_path` is the directory of the plugin package.

### Package the Bundle Project

Run the following command to package the Bundle plugin:

```bash
dify-plugin bundle package ./bundle
```

After executing the command, a `bundle.difybndl` file will be automatically created in the current directory. This file is the final packaged result.
