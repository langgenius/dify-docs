### Publishing Methods

To meet the publishing needs of different developers, Dify provides the following three plugin publishing methods. Before publishing, please ensure that you have completed the development and testing of your plugin, and have read [Basic Concepts of Plugin Development](/plugin-dev-en/0111-getting-started-dify-plugin) and [Plugin Developer Guidelines](/plugin-dev-en/0312-contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct).

#### **1. Marketplace**

* After official review, the plugin will be publicly available in the marketplace for other users to install and use.
